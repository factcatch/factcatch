[{"Origins": "In August 2015, a survey scam promising customers $100 off \"Back to School\" coupons for the Meijer hypermarket chain began circulating online: The $100 Meijer coupon scam is very similar to other schemes aimed at defrauding the customers of Target, Publix, Kroger, and Home Depot, all of which redirect users to a web site where they are asked to like, share, and/or comment on the coupons, ensuring that the scams get passed around social media:", "Fact Check": "Is Meijer offering $100 off \"Back to School\" coupons?", "Description": "While each of these scams feature slight variations, they typically redirect users to survey sites where they are asked to provide personal information such as e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, and credit card numbers. The Better Business Bureau offers these three tips to identify scams on Facebook: Don't believe what you see. It's easy to steal the colors, logos and header of an established organization. Scammers can also make links look like they lead to legitimate websites and emails appear to come from a different sender. Legitimate businesses do not ask for credit card numbers or banking information on customer surveys. If they do ask for personal information, like an address or email, be sure there's a link to their privacy policy. Watch out for a reward that's too good to be true. If the survey is real, you may be entered in a drawing to win a gift card or receive a small discount off your next purchase. Few businesses can afford to give away $50 gift cards for completing a few questions.

caption vaguely describing a pizza challenge was circulated on social media sites. According to rumors, the upfront cost for participating in the contest (purportedly $218) was steep, but participants were eligible for a refund and a $1,000 bonus if they consumed the entire pizza within a given timeframe (two hours, according to the meme). The pizza depicted is indeed a real menu item offered at Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria, a Southern California pizza chain.

We reached out to Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria's corporate offices to determine whether circulating claims about the pizza challenge were true, and according the company the pizza challenge as described in the meme is mostly accurate. Of the twenty Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria locations in Southern California, five currently possess the capability to serve the giant Sicilian pie, and the challenge is most commonly undertaken at their Burbank location. Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria said that participating locations generally require 48 hours notice to prepare for the challenge. As the meme states, a challenge group consisting of eight (not nine) people has two hours to eat the entire pizza (which consists of approximately 200 slices, measures 54\" by 54\", and weighs about 50 lbs). The pizza must have at least one topping and costs about $235, a price that is refunded should the participants successfully consume the entire pizza. The chain added that while three to four teams generally attempt the pizza challenge each month, so far only two contestant teams have managed to successfully complete the challenge and earn the $1,000 prize.

In that iteration, the photo wasn't rumored to have been taken in Florida. A roughly translated excerpt placed the implausible catch in Spain:", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The image shows a man proudly posing with giant prawn or shrimp, at least fifteen kilos of weight. The commentary accompanying the photo Ascent Sunday the Facebook group \"Asturias our land\" (with almost 2,700 members) - is as follows: \"Shrimp fish yesterday in the Asturian coast ... We big .. .! Pa a \"tapina '. Puxa!.\" Within hours the \"news\" circulated like wildfire and generated discussion threads among those who appreciated the humorous nature of the case and those who believed it. Once again, a hoax on the network (\"hoax\" in English) came to be taken as credible as if it were a proven information with rigor and professionalism. Google had yet another locale for the well-traveled fish, as a reverse image search automatically suggested Queensland as photo's location (discussed in an August 2015 forum thread). A separate search by image showed that the photograph was originally uploaded in 2010; it could have been taken (or altered) far earlier. The 2010 result led to a dead link, but was hosted on a web site for a fishing club in the Florida Keys (presumably, a catch of that nature would warrant a mention by avid sport fishermen). On 4 September 2014, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission published a status update to Facebook reporting the capture of a large, shrimp-like creature measuring 18 inches long: Who you calling a shrimp ?Steve Bargeron was fishing from a dock in Fort Pierce as he watched a fellow fisherman pull... Posted by MyFWC on Thursday, September 4, 2014 Who you calling a shrimp ?Steve Bargeron was fishing from a dock in Fort Pierce as he watched a fellow fisherman pull... Posted by MyFWC on Thursday, September 4, 2014 Those photographs didn't match the circulating \"102 lb. shrimp\" image, and the crustacean depicted wasn't technically a shrimp. The documented catch occurred in the Indian River near Fort Pierce, Florida and a weight wasn't provided. Professor of integrative biology Roy Caldwell told LiveScience that the 2014 find was unlikely to have occurred as described, and that photography was an unreliable barometer of mantis shrimp size: The specimen caught in Florida belongs to a species of Lysiosquilla, according to Caldwell. Like other members of its species, the creature has three pairs of walking legs and a large, articulated abdomen, Caldwell noted. \"This particular group Lysiosquillidae are almost all banded yellow and black across their bodies,\" Caldwell said. They can live for 30 years and can grow to be 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) long, he added ... this specimen doesn't belong to the largest of stomatopod species, according to the biologist. That distinction goes to Lysiosquillina maculata, which inhabit the Pacific Ocean from Hawaii to east Africa. Caldwell said the largest known members of the species were 15 inches (38 cm) long. Caldwell, who said he's been studying stomatopods for 50 years, said an 18-inch catch is unlikely. Photos, he pointed out, can sometimes be deceiving. He also noted that, with its claws extended, a stomatopod tends to look much longer than it really is. The standard for measuring the creatures is from the tip of the eye to the end of the tail claws not included. Marine biologists doubted that the purported 18-inch long mantis shrimp was as big as estimates claimed in 2014, and it was thrown back almost immediately (preventing further examination). Moreover, the documented newsworthy crustacean catch occurred in September 2014, whereas the viral photo of indeterminate origin existed as early as March 2010.

The claim cleverly layered the suggestion of a falsehood within its own fabrication to facilitate the spread of the story; by that sleight of hand, readers surmised the girl had lied about her sexual experience and had blamed the flu vaccine to deflect suspicion about the true nature of her pregnancy. None of this (neither the girl's claims nor the article reporting them) was true, however. World News Daily Report is just one of many fake news sites that print fictitious articles, as noted in their disclaimer: WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website even those based on real people are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle. World News Daily Report previously spread fake news stories about loggers accidentally cutting down the world's largest tree, Yoko Ono's admitting to an affair with Hillary Clinton, and a 179-year-old man living in India.

Charles Bolden, who was appointed to head of NASA by President Obama, issued a 1000 page document explaining the event to the White House.

Newswatch33 is a fake news site began darkening the doorstep of social media networks shortly after the nearly identical NewsWatch28 fake news site shut down in mid-2015. Moreover, the \"15 days of darkness\" yarn was lifted from an older (debunked) viral rumor that has been around the online block several times before. Newswatch33 has hoaxed social media users a number of times since its inception, falsely claiming that supporters raised $4 million for the defense of Charleston shooting suspect Dylann Roof, that a girl was electrocuted by her iPhone's earbuds, that Jay-Z and Beyonce purchased the rights to the Confederate flag, and that the federal government had impregnated inexpensive cigars with listening devices. In October 2015, the fake news web site Huzlers published an article titled \"NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2015!\"; that article essentially repackaged the original fabrication. Previous Huzlers hoaxes included a claim that semen was found in Starbucks drinks nationwide, that McDonald's was busted using \"human meat,\" that Chipotle was caught using cat and dog meat in their meals, and that an Ebola victim rose from the dead as a zombie.

The format is easily recognizable as one wherein words are attributed to the individual pictured, and in this case image claims that Donald Trump made the following statement in a 1998 interview with People magazine: If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.", "Fact Check": "Did Donald Trump say in 1998 that he would one day run as a Republican because they are the \"dumbest group of voters\"?", "Description": "Despite People's comprehensive online content archive, we found no interview or profile on Donald Trump in 1998 (or any other time) that quoted his saying anything that even vaguely resembled the words in this meme. Trump appeared somewhat regularly in the magazine's pages before he came to star on The Apprentice, but the bulk of the magazine's celebrity-driven coverage of him back then centered on his marriages to, and divorces from, Ivana Trump and Marla Maples. Trump's political endeavors (or the absence of them) did rate some space on the magazine's pages, though. For example, a December 1987 profile titled \"Too Darn Rich\" chronicled Trump's later claims that he had been courted by both Democrats and Republicans: House Speaker Jim Wright led a delegation to Trump's office asking him to chair a major fund-raising event for the Democratic Party. Trump is a Republican but gave the invitation serious consideration before bowing to pressure from GOP friends and turning down his Democratic suitors. Beryl Anthony Jr., the Arkansas Congressman who came up with the approach to Trump, was disappointed. \"There's no question he was getting a lot of pressure from the Republicans,\" Anthony told a reporter. \"It would have given him the opportunity to see if his temperament is sufficient, if he could stand the scrutiny.\" In 1988, Trump launched into an impassioned political diatribe on Oprah Winfrey's daytime talk show, but he concluded by saying he \"probably\" wouldn't [ever] run for office. In 1998 (the year the quote in question purportedly appeared in People), Trump's political involvement was somewhat differently oriented: \"My information is that Donald Trump has raised in the ballpark of $1 million for the Bush campaign and the Republican Party,\" said Sen. Steven Geller, president of the National Council of Legislators from Gaming States. \"I have heard from too many sources, including Republican lobbyists, that although Mr. Bush is denying it, the deal [to allow Indian casinos in Florida) has been cut,\" Geller said. By October 1999, Trump had become more serious about dipping his toes in political waters. Announcing on CNN's Larry King Live that he was forming an exploratory committee with the intention of running for president, Trump said: I'm a registered Republican. I'm a pretty conservative guy. I'm somewhat liberal on social issues, especially health care, et cetera, but I'd be leaving another party, and I've been close to that party ... I think that nobody is really hitting it right. The Democrats are too far left. I mean, Bill Bradley, this is seriously left; he's trying to come a little more center, but he's seriously left. The Republicans are too far right. And I don't think anybody's hitting the chord, not the chord that I want hear, and not the chord that other people want to hear, and I've seen it. At around the same time in October 1998, Trump ran through his then-current political positions with NBC's Stone Phillips: Mr. TRUMP: I'd like to see major tax cuts. PHILLIPS: Along the line, for what the Republicans are talking about eight hundred billion or so? Would you go that far? Mr. TRUMP: Along the lines of that number, yes, approximately at that number, and could even be more. PHILLIPS: Health care? Mr. TRUMP: [I'm] liberal on health care, we have to take care of people that are sick. PHILLIPS: Universal health coverage? Mr. TRUMP: I like universal, we have to take care, there's nothing else. What's the country all about if we're not going to take care of our sick? PHILLIPS: Abortion? Mr. TRUMP: I hate the concept of abortion. I hate anything about abortion, and yet, I'm totally for choice. I think you have no alternative. PHILLIPS: Gun control? Where do you stand on that? Mr. TRUMP: If you could tell me that the bad guys, the criminals, wouldn't have guns, I'd be a hundred percent for gun control. But the fact is, if you have gun control, the only people that are going to obey the laws, are going to be the good guys. So the bad guys are going to have the guns, the good guys aren't going to have the guns, and what good does that do us? So, I'm not in favor of it. Notable about the image's apparently spurious Trump quote is its purported reference to Fox News in 1998. While the Fox News Channel was rolled out across major American news markets between 1996 and 2000 (and thus isn't entirely chronologically out of place in a circa-1998 quote), the network wasn't nearly as prominent or widely watched until the 2000 election of George W. Bush, the September 11th attacks in 2001, and the start of the Iraq War in 2002. Before that time, although Fox News was making its way into living rooms across the United States, it was not exceptionally well-known (or particularly regarded as a right-leaning outlet) in 1998.

Yorkers posted a photo purportedly showing a 41 lb rat that was caught in New York City:", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "41 pound rat recently caught in NYC... (via Chris Brannigan) While the above-displayed image has been shared by various outlets, no one has been able to provide any substantial information about the enormous rodent. If this rat truly was \"caught\" in New York City, it is most likely a brown rat, or Norway rat. The city has approximately two million brown rats, according to a 2014 study, but these animals can only grow to about 20 inches in length and 2 lbs in weight. But as many commenters pointed out on The New Yorker's post, the animal doesn't look like it was caught at all. The rat looks groomed and cleaned and was most likely someone's pet. If that's the case, the above-pictured animal is probably a Gambian Pouch Rat. While these animals are larger than the brown rat, they don't typically get any bigger than four pounds. So why does the rat pictured above appear so massive? It's likely the result of forced perspective. The person is holding the rat (you'll notice that their hands cannot be seen in the photo) is probably using a pole to place the animal closer to the camera. While this makes the rat appear larger in the photo, the animal pictured is just an average sized rat. For comparison's sake, here's a photo of a 3 foot Gambian Pouch Rat that was caught in New York in 2012: In summation, the above-displayed photo does not show a 41 lb rat that was caught in New York City. While we can't determine the exact dimensions of the above-pictured animal, it was likely someone's pet and weighed no more than four pounds.

that the Halloween celebrated on 31 October 2015 would be the 666th such event in history. If we assume that Halloween celebrations are held annually, this rumor suggests that the first Halloween took place in 1350. But Halloween does not have any definitive beginning (the holiday evolved over a long period of time and was influenced by several different cultures), and there is no basis for the notion that the first Halloween was held in 1350:", "Fact Check": "Will the Halloween celebrated on 31 October 2015 be the 666th in history?", "Description": "It is widely believed that many Hallowe'en traditions have evolved from an ancient Celtic festival called Samhain which was Christianised by the early Church. Pronounced sow-in, Samhain is a Gaelic word meaning 'end of the summer'. This festival is believed to have been a celebration of the end of the harvest, and a time of preparation for the coming winter. It is widely accepted that the early church missionaries chose to hold a festival at this time of year in order to absorb existing native Pagan practices into Christianity, thereby smoothing the conversion process. A letter Pope Gregory I sent to Bishop Mellitus in the 6th century, in which he suggested that existing places of non-Christian worship be adopted and consecrated to serve a Christian purpose, is often provided as supporting evidence of this method of acculturation. Encyclopaedia Britannica states that this date may have been chosen \"in an effort to supplant the Pagan holiday with a Christian observance\". The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions also claims that Hallowe'en \"absorbed and adopted the Celtic new year festival, the eve and day of Samhain\". However, there are supporters of the view that Hallowe'en, as the eve of All Saints' Day, originated entirely independently of Samhain and some question the existence of a specific pan-Celtic religious festival which took place on 31st October/1st November. While Nicholas Rogers argued in his book Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night that \"festivals commemorating the saints as opposed to the original Christian martyrs appear to have been observed by 800,\" it is unclear when these festivals became what we know now as Halloween. According to various dictionaries, the word \"Halloween\" itself originated in the mid-18th century, a shortening of a term that dates to the mid-16th century: c.1745, Scottish shortening of Allhallow-even \"Eve of All Saints, last night of October\" (1550s), the last night of the year in the old Celtic calendar, where it was Old Year's Night, a night for witches. A pagan holiday given a cursory baptism and sent on its way. In the United States, Halloween was initially known as an occasion for playing pranks; the modern form of Halloween celebration didn't gain widespread popularity there until the early 20th century. Anoka, Minnesota, is often credited with holding the first official Halloween celebration in the United States, which took place in 1920: Anoka, Minnesota is believed to be the first city in the United States to put on a Halloween celebration to divert its youngsters from Halloween pranks. When Anokans awoke to find their cows roaming Main Street, their windows soaped and their outhouses tipped over, they decided something had to be done. In 1920, George Green and other Anoka civic leaders suggested the idea of a giant celebration. The idea was adopted by the Anoka Commercial Club and the Anoka Kiwanis Club; both giving their full support. In September of that year, a Halloween committee was organized. It's impossible to pinpoint an exact year for the first Halloween, and the rumor about 2015's seeing the \"666th Halloween\" seems to be an offshoot of earlier joke memes claiming that in the current year Halloween will fall on Friday the 13th for the first time in 666 years.

The idea that dangerous social media challenges are popular seems to be on the upswing. The ice bucket challenge of mid-2014 may well have inspired the increase in social media challenge fads; but parental fears of largely non-existent practices such as \"rainbow parties,\" vodka-infused tampons, bedbug smoking, and 'beezin preceded it.", "Fact Check": "Are teenagers daring one another to participate in the 72-hour challenge \"Game of 72,\" then disappearing for several days?", "Description": "In 2015, anxious parents feared that the paracetamol challenge would inspire their children to overdose on over-the-counter painkillers; and in the same vein, the 72-hour challenge (also known as the \"Game of 72\") prompted concerns that kids were participating in a pointless and dangerous social media fad. In April 2015, the Daily Mail published a thinly-sourced article titled \"Parents left terrified by cruel new 'game' on Facebook that sees children dare each other to vanish for 72 hours without telling relatives.\" As with other panics of similar nature, the article breathlessly described a \"game\" that sounded of no real interest to teens whatsoever and included scant evidence that participants were actually undertaking the purported challenge: An alleged Facebook game which sees children dare each other to vanish without a trace for up to three days is spreading panic among parents in France. The dare, dubbed the 'Game of 72', involves teenagers challenging each other to disappear without a word to their families for 12, 24 or 72 hours. Authorities have been alerted to the game after a 13-year-old girl from northern France went missing for three days. So far, police say, the only evidence is dozens of panicked Facebook posts being shared by parents, warning each other about the game, and Emma's testimony, to suggest the challenge exists. That article referenced France's The Local, whose original article (also published on 29 April 2015) was far plainer in describing what was in all likelihood a classic urban legend of the crime-warning variety. The article admitted that the \"Game of 72 could even be more of a hoax than an actual phenomenon\" but went on to say that the \"fact that officials are taking the incident seriously is perhaps unsurprising given France's troubling history when it comes to dangerous social media crazes\": News of the latest challenge came after a 13-year-old girl from northern France who went missing for three days finally turned up safe and well at her home at the weekend. The girl, named Emma in the French press, reportedly refused to tell police or her parents where she had been or whom she had been with, but simply said she had taken on a dare through Facebook called '12, 24, 72' or 'Game of 72', as it is also known. The Facebook challenge, meanwhile, has left authorities baffled not least because they've been unable to actually find examples of it online. Rather, they've uncovered plenty of panicked postings from parents who are eager to warn each other about the game. This one below says \"Attention Danger!\" and warns of \"another stupid game doing the rounds on the net\". It tells parents to explain to their children that its better to fail the dare rather have \"something tragic happen to them.\" The fact that a 13-year-old girl in France named Emma disappeared for three days at some point in April 2015 has been proffered as the sole piece of evidence documenting that the \"Game of 72\" is a real phenomenon. But there's just one problem that story about Emma doesn't check out: Francois Perain, the prosecutor in Valenciennes, the district where the incident took place, [said] that the game \"seems to be an excuse\". \"Actually we think that Emma joined up with someone when she ran away, and that was the main reason for her running away,\" he said. \"Everything points to the fact that the game (which may be imaginary) is the explanation that Emma gave as the reason why she ran away, and to protect the person she met. That person is currently being looked for by the police,\" he said. Aside from that discredited story, the only evidence such a \"challenge\" had occurred consisted of ping-ponging warnings among French parents on social media sites issued after the fact. Moreover, no one was even sure if the kids participating were hiding for 12, 24, or 72 hours. It took about a week for the Game of 72 to make its way to North America, but by that point a \"small number\" of \"temporary disappearances in Europe\" had stolen French Emma's thunder: Halton police are warning parents to talk to their children about a dangerous new game allegedly making the rounds on social media known as the Game of 72. It encourages young people to disappear and stay hidden for 72 hours without contacting friends or family, said police. The Game of 72 is being blamed for a small number of temporary disappearances in Europe, but so far, no missing person cases have been attributed to it in Canada or the U.S., according to media reports. Even so, the game had Vancouver police worried enough to issue a warning about it earlier this week. (\"Possibly one, maybe not\" is indeed a very small number, and it should be noted that a social media challenge is a far better excuse to one's parents than \"I snuck out and was scared to come home\" or \"I ran away and changed my mind.\") At around the same time, scattered police departments began to warn parents about the terrifying new craze: On 7 May 2015, Mic published an article that cast doubt on whether the 72-hour challenge was a genuine teen fad or media invention. And much like the February 2015 rumor of measles parties, it seemed news outlets reached to find \"evidence\" of police concern about the purported trend: \"We never issued a warning about the game as has been reported,\" Constable Brian Montague, a spokesman for the Vancouver Police Department (VPD), said. \"We responded to questions about it from media and unfortunately they turned it into a warning from police.\" The VPD was featured in a recent news story about the fad, which included an interview with an online awareness expert. \"The game's popularity shows that parents need to stay up to the minute on their kids' computer habits,\" the story reads. On the contrary, Montague told Mic, the department hasn't come across any instances of the game in Vancouver. \"I am not even aware of any confirmed examples in Canada,\" he said. A lack of any confirmed incidents whatsoever and a corresponding absence of any social media chatter (aside from people wondering why kids would undertake the 72-hour challenge) didn't discourage news outlets from advancing the rumor once again in June 2015: https://twitter.com/EyesOfARedWolf/status/611126365379784704 In a thread published by Kathy Sweeney of Southeastern Missouri television station KFVS, numerous users speculated that multiple reported disappearances were linked to the game. Sweeney claimed a \"Facebook page\" was \"encouraging\" kids to participate (but appeared to be unable to produce a link to it) and reiterated the unsupported assertion that the \"game\" had first appeared in Europe: There's even a Facebook page dedicated to it please share to warn other parents! ... Not sure but it apparently already made the rounds in Europe. As BBC Trending blogger Mike Wendling observed about the \"Game of 72\": For a \"game\" that is supposedly catching on all over the world, there's scant chatter about it on social media. Only a few hundred tweets have been sent about the \"game\" most referencing news articles. Facebook searches in English and French throw up relatively few hits and again, most link to media reports. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which runs the UK's best-known helpline for children, told Trending that they haven't received any calls about the \"game\". Some of the coverage of the \"game\" compared it to other trends such as neknomination the viral challenge where people were egging friends on to complete a dangerous and/or drinking-related stunt. But whereas neknomination was a real thing as were other potentially dangerous games such as the \"cinnamon challenge\" the \"game of 72\" appears to be nothing more than a lost-in-translation rumour.

I don t have the right to any other view. My only emotion is gratitude, literally, for my life.\"", "Fact Check": "Did Jack Nicholson say that he was \"positively against\" abortion?", "Description": "This short statement is full of humility, wisdom, and courage. Note that he says, I don t have the right to any other view. He has understood, thanks to the knowledge that his own life almost never happened, that life is a gift for which we should all feel gratitude. His willingness to vocally oppose abortion in the face of Hollywood and his own political party is inspiring and should be encouraged. While these articles were presented as current news stories, that is not the case. Nicholson's statement comes from a 1984 interview with Rolling Stone magazine in which the actor talked about his complicated family life. During the interview, Nicholson said that he was \"positively against\" abortion since his mother June nearly decided to end her pregnancy: I'm very contra my constituency in terms of abortion because I'm positively against it. I don't have the right to any other view. My only emotion is gratitude, literally, for my life. If June and Ethel had been of less character, I would never have gotten to live. These women gave me the gift of life. It's a feminist narrative in the very pure form. Despite Nicholson's comments to Rolling Stone in 1984, the actor told the Washington Post in 1990 that while he was personally against abortion he still considered himself to be politically pro-choice: \"I'm pro-choice but against abortion because I'm an illegitimate child myself and it would be hypocritical to take any other position. I'd be dead. I wouldn't exist,\" the star and director of \"The Two Jakes\" said in a Washington Post interview. \"And I have nothing but total admiration, gratitude and respect for the strength of the women who made the decision they made in my individual case. But as I say, I believe this is the choice of the woman and, you know, I walk it like I talk it.\" Nicholson was 38 when he learned that his \"mother\" was really his grandmother and that the woman he had known as his sister was in fact his mother. While Jack Nicholson did say that he was \"positively against\" abortion, his comment was made decades ago and doesn't fully address the actor's more nuanced views on the subject.

Customers reported hearing loud squealing coming from the bathroom in the back area of the store near the layaway department. An eyewitness said her seven-year-old son went in to use the restroom, and came out screaming, Mommy, mommy is a man in the bathroom holding a pig really close to him!", "Fact Check": "Was an Alabama man caught having sex with a pig in a Walmart bathroom?", "Description": "Confused, the woman alerted a store clerk and was informed they already had several complaints about noise in the restroom. Raymond Cooper, an employee at the Walmart store, said he was the one that ran in and saved the pig. When I went into the bathroom, I heard squealing from inside the stall. I told the man to open it but he wouldn t, so I kicked it in. That crazy ass fool for real was doing a pig. I socked him in the face and grabbed the pig. That fool was out cold. However, Now8News (styled to mimic a local television station news site, like KLAS) is a newcomer to the burgeoning fake news genre, one that further aims to confuse readers by blending wildly sensational claims like the one above with re-writes of actual news events. The pig sex tale is (of course) false, and the mugshot was one of sovereign citizen and former fugitive Edward Eugene Harper. On 17 July 2015, Now8News published cannibalized a fabricated claim (involving a man on a park bench being eaten by pigeons) which first appeared on the similar fake news site NewsWatch28. On the same date, Now8News published a different, entirely made-up story claiming McDonald's was caught using aborted fetuses in Chicken McNuggets.

"Example": "[Collected via e-mail, January 2016] Hey guys! Can you please check out this \"800 year old cell phone found\" story that's floating around the internet? Origin:On 23 December 2015, the conspiracy theory web site Mysterious Universe published a photo purportedly showing an ancient clay tablet resembling a cellphone which was dug up by archaeologists \"earlier this year\" in Austria: While Mysterious Universe failed to provide the details you'd expect from a possibly world-changing dig, such as the names of the archaeologists, secondary photos of the tablet, comments from the team, the object's dimensions, et cetera, the web site did manage to add some wild speculation about the object: A controversial theory proposed by author Zecharia Sitchin is that aliens known as the Anunnaki came from Nibiru (the rumored Planet X beyond Neptune) and created the Sumerian civilization. The tablet looks surprisingly like a modern phone, with the 12 keys, a display and a talk button. Could these extraterrestrials have tried to introduce the Sumerians to a phone-like communications device, only to find they weren t ready for it and dialed them back to a stylus and clay tablets? While the theory that the above-displayed cellphone was created by the alien race Anunnaki from the planet Nibiru in order to introduce the Sumerian civilization to modern technology is interesting, this \"alien cellphone\" was actually created by a German sculptor and is only a few years old. Karin and Karl Weing rtner of the Art Replik Studio created the clay tablet in January 2012. While the photo was originally shared with a description similar to the one published by Mysterious Universe (Art Replik never mentioned aliens) there are several indications that this post was simply a joke, such as the title of the object, \"BablyoNokia,\" comments on the photo (\"Yes, exactly!\" in response to \"is that my old phone\"), and the fact that the image was watermarked art-replik.com. The \"alien phone\" was created in jest and was likely used as a marketing tool: The above-displayed \"ancient cellphone\" was not discovered by a group of archaeologists in Austria and it was not left behind by aliens. It was created by a German sculptor who specializes in making replicas of ancient art.

William Shakespeare's plays began circulating online. Although the authorship of Shakespeare's plays remains a topic of some debate among scholars, the above-displayed meme contains several factual errors. First, Aemilia Bassano (later Emilia Lanier) was indeed a published author, not someone whose work was suppressed because of her race or gender. In fact, the Shakespearean Authorship Trust notes that Bassano became the \"first woman to publish a book of original poetry\" when her work Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum was put into print in 1611:", "Fact Check": "Is a black woman named Amelia Bassano the true author of all of William Shakespeare's plays?", "Description": "Brought up opposite the theatre district in a family of Venetian Jews of Moroccan ancestry, at the age of 7 she was given to be educated by Countess Susan Bertie, in the family headed by Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby. At the age of 13 she became mistress to Lord Hunsdon, the man in charge of the English theatre. When she got pregnant a decade later she was expelled from court and married off to a minstrel. She was one of the first women to own and operate a school and the first woman to publish a book of original poetry Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum (1611). She died in poverty. Second, Bassano was not black. She was born to Baptista Bassano (a Venice musician at the court of Elizabeth I) and Margaret Johnson in 1569, and biographies of her note that: (Amelia Bassano) was part of a family of Italian court musicians of Moroccan/Semitic ancestry who lived as clandestine Jews. No contemporaneous accounts describe Bassano as \"black\" (or \"African\"), and although its provenance is uncertain, many historians believe that this miniature portrait by Nicholas Hilliard depicts Amelia Bassano: Amelia Bassano have been dark-complected, however. A 2009 paper published in the Oxfordian, the journal of Shakespearean authorship studies, stated that some of Bassano's relatives were referred to as \"black\" when they arrived in London, likely due to their dark complexions: Brought to London from Venice in 1538/9, the dark-skinned Bassanos, some of whom were described in contemporary records as 'black' and who may have been of Moroccan as well as Jewish ancestry, became established as the Court recorder troupe.\" Lastly, the claim that Amelia Bassano wrote all of William Shakespeare's plays is a decidedly fringe notion, even within the world of Shakespearean authorship controversies. While she is listed as a potential candidate by the Shakespearean Authorship Trust (a group seemingly determined to credit Shakespeare's work to anyone but Shakespeare himself), even among that group she is included as just one of 66 candidates identified so far: She has long been identified as the 'dark lady' of the Sonnets. Her candidacy was announced in March 2007 in a lecture at the Smithsonian Institution as part of the Washington Shakespeare Festival by John Hudson, artistic director of the Dark Lady Players, a New York company who perform the underlying Jewish allegories in the plays.

(Almost immediately, that decision led to a number of rumors and viral claims; that pedophiles would soon be granted similar rights, that Joe Biden had gone on a victory spree, and that Facebook had begun tracking the political beliefs of users via a celebratory rainbow filter for profile pictures.) Tangential rumors circulated pertaining to individuals and businesses who subsequently (or previously) went out on a limb for their religious opposition to marriage equality, which included a false claim involving a pastor purportedly jailed for refusing to marry a gay couple and the true case of an Oregon bakery ordered to pay damages stemming from a pre-decision refusal to serve a same-sex couple. The meme displayed above was inspired by Kentucky court clerk named Kim Davis, who unwittingly starred in a viral video during which she refused to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple shortly after the June 2015 Supreme Court ruling.", "Fact Check": "Did Kentucky hire an Amish DMV clerk who refused to issue driver's licenses based on her religious beliefs?", "Description": "On 12 August 2015, U.S. District Judge David L. Bunning ordered Davis [PDF] to begin issuing licenses as requested. Bunning wrote in his ruling that by \"openly adopting a policy that promotes her own religious convictions at the expenses of others,\" Davis had violated the law, adding: Davis remains free to practice her Apostolic Christian beliefs. She may continue to attend church twice a week, participate in Bible Study and minister to female inmates at the Rowan County Jail. She is even free to believe that marriage is a union between one man and one woman, as many Americans do. However, her religious convictions cannot excuse her from performing the duties that she took an oath to perform as Rowan County Clerk. The humorous image above was clearly created to poke fun at Davis over the legal dispute (and the general issue of allowing personal religious beliefs to trump the requirements of employment and public service), a subtlety lost on many social media users who hadn't heard of the marriage license controversy in Kentucky and consequently didn't get the joke. The jape partially relies outsider assumptions about Amish culture, one of which is the notion that Amish people are prohibited from driving due to their religion. That's not precisely accurate, as use of a horse-and-buggy over cars is primarily a cultural choice and not part of a specific anti-automobile religious edict applied to everyone: Although the Amish are allowed to use automobiles for social and business functions, the church rules prohibit members from owning as well as driving a car. Amish businessmen are also not allowed to provide loans to non-Amish employees for the purpose of buying a vehicle. Ownership of an automobile is considered a taboo. It is important to the community to maintain the horse and buggy as a symbol of Amish identity. The joke also leans on a (fallacious) assumption that Amish citizens neither seek nor require state driver's licenses, part of a broad, inaccurate perception of the community as frightened of the outside world. The Amish often need state-issued ID for a variety of day-to-day purposes, including the operation of lucrative businesses (contrary to the belief Amish people reject wealth and/or financial success entirely or that they lack awareness of modern conventions). Photographic requirements have presented problems for Amish people seeking licenses, however, as their traditions generally favor the avoidance of photography. (Yet another misconception asserts the practice is due to a primitive, uneducated fear that the camera might \"steal\" a person's soul; in actuality, it's more due to intentional humility and not a fear of technology.) While the meme seen here satirizes the imposition of religious belief on outsiders by a presumably stricter sect, it should be noted that Amish communities are known for a marked disinclination to interact with the \"English\" world save for necessary circumstances. Although their religious beliefs are notoriously stringent, Amish folks are far likelier to be encroached upon by a conflict of law and faith than the other way around.

government building at Oregon's Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, posted a message comparing his actions to those of civil rights leader Rosa Parks: While the above-displayed message was posted by the Twitter account @Ammon_Bundy, it doesn't appear that the rancher has anything to do with the account. First, this is a brand new Twitter account which was started on 3 January 2016. While it is possible that Bundy would start a new Twitter account to take advantage of the media attention, the rancher has had a Facebook account for more than a year and frequently uses the social network to provide updates from Oregon. Second, the @Ammon_Bundy Twitter account uses a screenshot from one of Bundy's videos as its profile pic. If the account were real, it's likely that Bundy would have used an actual photo. Finally, MSNBC reporter Tony Dokoupil, who has been reporting from the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge since shortly after Bundy's men took over the building, confirmed that the account was fake: While it's possible that someone associated with the Bundy is operating the @Ammon_Bundy Twitter account, it's more likely that the account is being operated by a remote sympathizer.

While the exact origins of the above-displayed image are unknown, it is a composite of two separate photos. The photo of Amy Winehouse was taken in 2011 in London: Amy Winehouse heads to the Hawley Arms pub in Camden, north London, wearing a pink Pringle sweater. Amy had earlier attended a recording session at the famous Abbey Road studios with Taylor Swift. The photograph of Lana Del Rey was taken in 2012 before a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert: This photo of Lana Del Rey was flipped in order to make the composite image of Rey and Winehouse. One way to tell that the image has been flipped is by looking at the lettering on Del Rey's AC/DC shirt, which is backwards on the composite image. This isn't the first time that a composite image of two celebrities has circulated as the real thing. Shortly after the deaths of Lemmy and David Bowie, a fake photograph purportedly showing the two together at a party went viral.

That Facebook post, which also included a response from Special Olympics athlete John Franklin Stephens, quickly went viral and racked up more than a half million shares in 24 hours:", "Fact Check": "Did Ann Coulter refer to President Obama as a \"retard,\" prompting a response from a Special Olympics athlete?", "Description": "Some people who viewed the Facebook post questioned its authenticity, as they couldn't find the \"Obama retard\" tweet in Coulter's Twitter feed. The reason for that was because the referenced comment was one she made after a 2012 presidential debate between President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney, not something Coulter said in 2015 as implied by the Facebook post: Shortly after the tweet made headlines in 2012, Ann Coulter appeared on Alan Colmes' Fox News radio show to double down on her trolling: \"Look, no one would refer to a Down Syndrome child, someone with an actual mental handicap, by saying 'retard.' Where do you think the words 'imbecile,' 'idiot,' 'moron,' 'cretin' come from? These were all technical terms at one time. 'Retard' had been used colloquially to just mean 'loser' for 30 years ... But no, no these aggressive victims have to come out and tell you what words to use.\" The response from Special Olympics athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens is also real, although also not recent. On 23 October 2012, Stephens posted it as open letter to Coulter on the Special Olympics Blog: Dear Ann Coulter, Come on Ms. Coulter, you aren t dumb and you aren t shallow. So why are you continually using a word like the R-word as an insult? I m a 30 year old man with Down syndrome who has struggled with the public s perception that an intellectual disability means that I am dumb and shallow. I am not either of those things, but I do process information more slowly than the rest of you. In fact it has taken me all day to figure out how to respond to your use of the R-word last night. I thought first of asking whether you meant to describe the President as someone who was bullied as a child by people like you, but rose above it to find a way to succeed in life as many of my fellow Special Olympians have. Then I wondered if you meant to describe him as someone who has to struggle to be thoughtful about everything he says, as everyone else races from one snarkey sound bite to the next. Finally, I wondered if you meant to degrade him as someone who is likely to receive bad health care, live in low grade housing with very little income and still manages to see life as a wonderful gift. Because, Ms. Coulter, that is who we are and much, much more. After I saw your tweet, I realized you just wanted to belittle the President by linking him to people like me. You assumed that people would understand and accept that being linked to someone like me is an insult and you assumed you could get away with it and still appear on TV. I have to wonder if you considered other hateful words but recoiled from the backlash. Well, Ms. Coulter, you, and society, need to learn that being compared to people like me should be considered a badge of honor. No one overcomes more than we do and still loves life so much. Come join us someday at Special Olympics. See if you can walk away with your heart unchanged.

during that time, a circulating rumor claimed Anne Frank was denied entry to the United States before her death in the Holocaust. While most Americans were familiar with Anne Frank (and many read her diary in school), the claim labeling her a prospective refugee seemed novel. Its appearance during an ongoing debate about Syrian refugees similarly prompted some skepticism among those who hadn't before heard the it, as Frank's ordeal and death comprised a story with which many were familiar.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "On 14 February 2007 The New York Times published an article titled \"Letters reveal desperate plight of Anne Frank's family,\" reporting that documents newly uncovered by an accident of circumstance revealed the Frank family's failed attempts at entry to the U.S.: After lying undisturbed in a New Jersey warehouse for nearly 30 years, documents revealing the desperate efforts of Anne Frank's family to escape to the United States and Cuba from Nazi-occupied Holland in 1941 have been discovered thanks to a clerical error. \"I am forced to look out for emigration and as far as I can see U.S.A. is the only country we could go to,\" Anne's father, Otto, wrote to his college friend, Nathan Straus Jr., the head of the federal Housing Authority, a friend of Eleanor Roosevelt's and the son of a Macy's co-owner, asking him to put up a $5,000 bond. \"It is for the sake of the children mainly that we have to care for. Our own fate is of less importance,\" Otto Frank wrote. Page by page, the papers illustrate the tortuous process for gaining entry to the United States in those days. Even with powerful connections and money, European Jews could not overcome the State Department's restrictions against refugees, said two Holocaust scholars who examined the documents. As the war in Europe intensified, so too did Otto Frank's efforts to transport his family to safety. He ultimately settled on an attempt to enter through Cuba, a plan which never reached fruition: By June 1941, no one with close relatives still in Germany was allowed into the United States because of suspicions that the Nazis could use them to blackmail refugees into clandestine cooperation. That development ended the possibility of getting the Frank girls out through a children's rescue agency. Because of the uncertainty, Otto Frank decided to try for a single visa for himself. It was granted and forwarded to him on Dec. 1. No one knows if it arrived. Ten days later, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States and Havana canceled the visa. Reuters covered the discovery on 14 February 2007, including commentary from Holocaust scholars who lamented the family's failed attempt at passage: If her father had sought help sooner, \"Anne Frank could be a 77-year-old woman living in Boston today, a writer. That is what the YIVO's documents suggest,\" said Richard Breitman, a professor at American University. However, Otto Frank decided to try to escape just as the Nazis were making it more difficult to leave and the United States was making it more difficult to enter, Breitman said. Cuba issued Otto Frank a visa on December 1, 1941, according to the documents, but it was canceled 10 days later when Germany declared war on the United States. A 2007 TIME article provided further details of Otto Frank's increasingly desperate efforts: For nine months, they tried to secure visas first to the U.S. and then to Cuba until that window shut. Just three letters of the file were written by Otto Frank, all addressed to university friend Nathan Straus Jr., son of a co-owner of Macy's department store and head of the U.S. Housing Authority. Straus and Frank's brother-in-law, Julius Hollander, regularly corresponded with two private Jewish agencies, the National Refugee Service in New York and the Boston Committee for Refugees. Straus also contacted the State Department on Frank's behalf. Hollander and his brother arranged affidavits from their employers, Jacob Hiatt of E.F. Dodge Paper Box Co. and Harry Levine of the New England Novelty Co., both of Leominster, Mass. An April 2015 article titled \"Op-Ed: Getting Anne Frank All Wrong\" published to Arutz Sheva addressed the plight of Anne Frank and other Jewish refugee children who perished: Otto Frank, Anne's father, dutifully filled out the small mountain of required application forms and obtained supporting affidavits from the family's relatives in Massachusetts. But that was not enough for those who zealously guarded America's gates against refugees. In fact, in 1941, the Roosevelt administration even added a new restriction: no refugee with close relatives in Europe could come to the U.S., on the grounds that the Nazis might hold their relatives hostage in order to force the refugee to undertake espionage for Hitler. That's right: Anne Frank, Nazi spy. Anne s mother, Edith, wrote to a friend in 1939: \"I believe that all Germany's Jews are looking around the world, but can find nowhere to go.\" On 4 September 2015, Anne Frank's step-sister Eva Schloss drew direct parallels between the Syrian refugee crisis and the Jewish refugee crisis of World War II: You must not be selfish and you must share whatever you have and help in a desperate situation. They need help from you. These people have had the courage to do a very difficult thing- to take your family and your whole life to another country requires bravery and strength. This is history repeating itself. These Syrians are valuable, educated people. These are doctors and nurses who are only too willing to help our society and they will become leaders in the community if you let them. The claim that Anne Frank \"was a refugee\" confused some readers, as they hadn't heard it prior to the Syrian refugee crisis. But the extent to which Otto Frank tried (and failed) to save his family from death during World War II was only first reported in 2007, and thus didn't appear in many history lessons before that. Ultimately Frank perished (likely of Typhus) at Bergen-Belsen in 1945, shortly after the deaths of her mother and sister Margot.

Mayor Kent Guinn, Ocala, Florida Mayor Tom Henry, Fort Wayne Indiana And it is true that a large, established Twitter account linked to Anonymous promised the release of information about prominent

Operation KKK (@Operation_KKK) October 22, 2015 However, the articles cited documents published anonymously to the site Pastebin, to which anyone may upload text-based content.

If you have internet access and the ability to type then you are qualified. Best of all we will pay you if it s good. You talk directly to the editors no form letter rejections. Your work could be seen by millions of people. We are looking for highly unqualified individuals (qualified people are welcome too) familiar with writing, photoshop, infographics, videos, and apps.

In addition to the fact that the the only requirement needed to write for MSMBC.co is the ability to type, the search box for the web site promises users that \"bullcrap\" is only a click away: MSMBC.co is also responsible for a similar death hoax involving country music singer Willie Nelson.

"Example": "[Collected via Twitter, January 2016] Origin:On 10 January 2016, a rumor started circulating on Twitter that former Full House star Ashley Olsen had been murdered in Italy. While most celebrity death hoaxes stem from fake news reports or humorless pranks, the rumor about actress Ashley Olsen's death was rooted in a real, and tragic, news story. The Associated Press reports that another woman named Ashley Olsen, an American artist and fashionista, was found dead in her apartment in Florence: The American artist and fashionista found dead in her apartment in Italy last week was strangled, according to autopsy results announced by Italian investigators Tuesday. The body of 35-year-old Ashley Olsen was discovered in her Florence home on Saturday. She died as a result of murder by strangulation with either a rope or cord-like object, authorities told reporters. Olsen, who is originally from Summer Haven, Florida, was living in the Oltrarno district of Florence and working in the fashion industry. She left the United States for Italy a few years ago to be close to her father, according to Italian news agency ANSA. In addition to sharing the same name, the former Full House star fit the \"American artist\" description and is also approximately the same age (29) as the murder victim. These similarities led many people to mistakenly believe that the Ashley Olsen who was killed in Italy was the same Ashley Olsen who appeared on the TV show Full House. On 12 January 2016, the artist's friends called for Italian authorities to bring her killer to justice: Olsen's friends demanded for her killer to be brought to justice in a letter that appeared in The Florentine, an English-language news magazine. \"Ashley was a rare and kindhearted spirit. She immediately became a familiar part of life in the Oltrarno where she lived, embraced by everyone who knew her,\" they wrote. \"While we mourn her passing we place our trust fully in the Italian authorities to investigate this tragic episode. We wait to hear what they discover, and pray that justice will be swiftly served to whoever is responsible.\" The investigation into Olsen's death is ongoing.

"Example": "[Collected via Email, December 2015] Is this true? Asteroid that Could Cause Disaster Headed Toward Earth on Christmas Eve? Origin:Santa Claus and his reindeer won't be the only objects flying through the sky this Christmas -- an asteroid will be hurtling through the solar system, as well. According to several sensationalized headlines that were published in December 2015, Asteroid 2003 SD220 will come dangerously close to earth on Christmas Eve. \"Asteroid that Could Cause Disaster Headed Toward Earth on Christmas Eve\" The newest asteroid being tracked due to its close proximity to earth is colossal. It s so huge that some claim its gravitational pull could cause earthquakes and make volcanoes erupt. Ironically, it s expected to just barely skim past Earth on Christmas eve. The 1.5 mile wide slab of rock known as 2003 SD220 is so large it could potentially wipe out a continent in the case of a direct hit. While it is true that Asteroid 2003 SD220 will pass by Earth on Christmas Eve, the above-quoted article gets several facts wrong. First, the asteroid will not be getting disconcertingly close to Earth. According to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the closest that the asteroid will get is about 6.8 million miles: \"There is no cause for concern over the upcoming flyby of asteroid 2003 SD220 this Christmas Eve,\" said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for NEO Studies at JPL. \"The closest this object will come to Santa and his eight tiny reindeer is about 28 times the distance between Earth and the moon.\" \"It's going miss Earth by a wide swath, and not be any hazard,\" JPL spokesperson Guy Webster told us. The asteroid also is not \"colossal.\" According to Space.com, the asteroid is relatively small at \"only about 1.24 miles\" wide. Asteroid 2003 SD220's flyby on Christmas Eve is basically a non-event for people outside of the astronomy field, as it is so small and distant that it will not even be visible to the naked eye. This is also not the first time that Asteroid 2003 SD220 has passed by Earth, and it will not be the last. According to NASA, it will make another flyby in 2018: \"The radar images data suggest that asteroid 2003 SD220 is highly elongated and at least 3,600 feet [1,100 meters] in length,\" said Lance Benner of JPL, who leads NASA's asteroid radar research program. \"The data acquired during this pass of the asteroid will help us plan for radar imaging during its upcoming closer approach in 2018.\" Three years from now, the asteroid will safely fly past Earth again, but even closer, at a distance of 1.8 million miles (2.8 million kilometers). The 2018 flyby will be the closest the asteroid will get to Earth until 2070, when it is expected to safely fly past our planet at a distance of about 1.7 million miles (2.7 million kilometers). JPL's Near Earth Object Office, which detects and tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and other space objects, is refuting and clarifying rumors on its verified Twitter account.

a number of social media rumors circulated about Syrian refugees; the above-reproduced photograph (published to Facebook on 14 September 2015) became popular among social media claims. While the photograph included little information about the two images it encompassed, the message of it was clear. At the top, purported Syrian refugees enjoyed luxury accommodations at an unnamed hotel; at the bottom, an American veteran and his dog were left to survive on the streets.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The top image was originally published by the British tabloid Express on 28 September 2014 (more than a year before its November 2015 popularity), along with an article titled \"EXCLUSIVE: Taxpayers fund migrants B&B rooms in top holiday destinations.\" The paper held: The Daily Express has learned that beleaguered Home Office officials have turned to Britannia Hotels, one of the UK s largest groups, to solve the UK s growing asylum epidemic. Coach loads of African and Arab refugees have checked in to the three-star Heathlands and Roundhouse hotels in Britain s premier destination resort while their claims for asylum are processed. The asylum seekers arrived here illegally, the majority via the Port of Calais, which is now home to 2,000 would-be illegal immigrants from a rainbow nation of war-torn countries like Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan. Whether or not those claims were accurate, a few things stood out. One was that the image depicted purported asylum seekers in the United Kingdom. As such, whatever their housing arrangements might have been, it bore little relevance to the plight of homeless American veterans. While an objection could be raised about the strategy of sheltering refugees in hotels overall, it isn't as if those British bed & breakfast rooms could have been used to get American servicemen off the streets of the U.S. The Express claimed asylum seekers enjoyed luxury accommodations, but the hotel the paper named maintained a very low 2.5 star rating on TripAdvisor. Nightly lodging rates for the property started at a miserly $52 a night, and travelers described it as \"cheap,\" \"run-down,\" in need of \"renovations,\" \"shabby,\" \"grubby,\" and \"the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.\" Several were moved to share pictorial representations of the luxury they enjoyed as non-refugee guests of the hotel: Moreover, the original article didn't reference the 2015 flood of refugees from Syria. It identified the asylum seekers in question as primarily from Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan. On 9 October 2014, Bournemouth's Daily Echo published an article titled \"Red Cross worker: the real story of the asylum seekers' \"seaside holiday\" in Bournemouth.\" According to that piece, the original claims were distorted and deliberately misleading: Enjoying a seaside break in luxury, complete with swimming pools and champagne: these are some of the ways the plight of asylum seekers being housed in hotels on the south coast have been described in recent weeks. As a British Red Cross worker, I d like to share with you what I saw. Last week, we arranged for an elderly woman to be taken to A&E because she had not eaten for three days. She was so weak she couldn t even walk. After the group were dropped off at the hotel, it took four days before anyone, including the local authority and the Red Cross, found out ... The hospital raised the alarm when two asylum seekers presented themselves at A&E. And that s when we were called in. We provided basics such as clothes, nappies and female sanitary products, as well as facilitating access to doctors, midwives and health visitors ... At the Red Cross, we support refugees and asylum seekers every day but I ve never seen so many people treated like this before. While it's true that asylum seekers were temporarily housed in a bed & breakfast in Bournemouth in 2014, the meme created the misleading impression that such accommodation was had at the expense of American veterans' care. The image was in fact purportedly taken in Britain in 2014, originally published as part of an anti-refugee missive. A Red Cross worker later stepped forward to clarify that the individuals housed in travel lodging were weak and ill upon their arrival in Britain, not enjoying the amenities of a free vacation. Moreover, whether the images truly depicted asylum seekers or merely involved three non-British vacation-goers remained to be seen. The Express didn't elaborate as to how they determined that the asylum seekers in question were the fellows depicted in the image.

drivers and passengers who are determined not to wear them, for any number of reasons: because they find them too uncomfortable or confining, because they don't believe in their efficacy, because they've heard that wearing seat belts might actually cost them their lives in certain types of accidents, or because they resent as an unwarranted intrusion of government into private life the plethora of laws now requiring motorists to buckle up.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "In this vein, we note with a sense of both sadness and irony a couple of articles recently called to our attention. The first is a 17 September 2004 editorial published in the Daily Nebraskan and entitled \"Individual Rights Buckle Under Seat Belt Laws,\" by Derek Kieper, a 21-year-old senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, in which the writer inveighed against mandatory seat belt laws, opining that \"Uncle Sam is not here to regulate every facet of life no matter the consequences,\" and that \"Democrats and Republicans alike should stand together to stop these laws that are incongruous with the ideals of both parties.\" In the midst of his editorial he noted: As laws become increasingly strict for seat belts, fewer people will respond positively by buckling up in response to the laws. There seems to be a die-hard group of non-wearers out there who simply do not wish to buckle up no matter what the government does. I belong to this group. Evidently his words were far more prescient than any of us might have wanted, as an article in the 4 January 2005 Lincoln Journal Star reported that Mr. Kieper not only died in a car crash, but the tragic mishap that claimed his life was the very type of accident in which seat belts have proved so effective in saving lives by preventing passengers from being ejected from vehicles: Derek Kieper was a smart, funny, intense young man who relished a good debate and would do anything for his friends. Kieper, a 21-year-old senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, died early Tuesday morning when the Ford Explorer he was a passenger in traveled off an icy section of Interstate 80 and rolled several times in a ditch. Kieper, who was riding in the back seat of the Explorer, was ejected from the vehicle. Two others in the vehicle, including the driver, Luke Havermann of Ogallala, and the front-seat passenger, Nick Uphoff of Randolph Air Force Base in Texas, sustained non-life threatening injuries. Havermann and Uphoff, both 21, were being treated at BryanLGH Medical Center West. Derek, who was thrown from the vehicle, was not wearing a seat belt, [Capt. Joe Lefler of the Lancaster County Sheriff's Office] said. He said Havermann and Uphoff were wearing seat belts at the time. In a similar vein, in July 2011 a helmetless motorcyclist participating in a ride to protest mandatory helmet laws was killed when he was thrown over the handlebars of his motorcycle in Onondaga, New York: Philip A. Contos, 55, of Parish, New York, was on a ride organized by the Onondaga chapter of American Bikers Aimed Towards Education (ABATE). Contos hit his brakes, began fishtailing and lost control of his 1983 Harley Davidson. He shot over the handlebars, hit his head on the pavement and was taken to Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse, New York, where he was pronounced dead. State police say evidence at the scene plus information from the attending medical expert indicated Contos would have survived had he been wearing a helmet as required by state law.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2005/01/04/local/doc41db350078259784029686.txt;http://web.archive.org/web/20041105191840/http://www.dailynebraskan.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2004/09/17/414a5a030e91d;", "Example": "", "Last Updated": "4 July 2011", "Credibility": "true", "URL": "www.snopes.com/autos/accident/seatbelt.asp", "Claim": "Anti-seat belt law advocate is killed in automobile accident.", "Claim_ID": "autos_accident_seatbelt", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/autos/accident/seatbelt.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.democraticunderground.com", "link": "http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=104x2931444", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.abovetopsecret.com", "link": "http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread113980/pg1", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.reddit.com", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/193pbq/til_derek_kieper_an_antiseat_belt_law_advocate/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.omgfacts.com", "link": "http://www.omgfacts.com/lists/5116/An-anti-seat-belt-law-advocate-died-because-he-didn-t-wear-a-seat-belt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.fiberpipe.net", "link": "http://www.fiberpipe.net/~tiktin/Documents/seatbeltskill.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.car-seat.org", "link": "http://www.car-seat.org/showthread.php?t=177175", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3ASeat_belt_legislation", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "fee.org", "link": "http://fee.org/freeman/the-fraud-of-seat-belt-laws/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "unusualdeaths.com", "link": "http://unusualdeaths.com/tag/car-accident/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "unusualdeaths.com", "link": "http://unusualdeaths.com/category/2005/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "unusualdeaths.com", "link": "http://unusualdeaths.com/category/usa/nebraska/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.nsc.org", "link": "http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/Pages/safety-at-home-motor-vehicle-crash.aspx", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.sputnikmusic.com", "link": "http://www.sputnikmusic.com/forums/showthread.php?t=288291", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.quora.com", "link": "https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-a-Seat-Belt-Law-in-the-U-S", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.hg.org", "link": "http://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=27503", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.debate.org", "link": "http://www.debate.org/debates/There-should-not-be-a-mandatory-seatbelt-law/1/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "fazed.net", "link": "http://fazed.net/867", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.john-adams.co.uk", "link": "http://www.john-adams.co.uk/2013/02/12/repeal-the-seat-belt-law/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "www.helmets.org", "link": "http://www.helmets.org/negativs.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.parents.com", "link": "http://www.parents.com/baby/safety/car/car-safety-facts-and-mistakes/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.phoenixazinjurylaw.com", "link": "http://www.phoenixazinjurylaw.com/seat-belts-help-prevent-car-accident-injuries-and-deaths", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.spmhlaw.com", "link": "http://www.spmhlaw.com/auto-accidents.php", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.bobistheoilguy.com", "link": "http://www.bobistheoilguy.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=394101", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.history.com", "link": "http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/unsafe-at-any-speed-hits-bookstores/print", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.skslawyers.com", "link": "http://www.skslawyers.com/InjuryAttorneyNewsAreas.asp?ID=14", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.autoblog.com", "link": "http://www.autoblog.com/2005/01/20/anti-seat-belt-wearer-dies-in-car-accident/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "driveforsafety.goodneighbors.com", "link": "http://driveforsafety.goodneighbors.com/", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "NASCAR champion Tony Stewart hit fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr. at a race track in western New York state on 9 August 2014, fatally injuring Ward.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The two drivers had been involved in a minor collision moments earlier on the track at Canandaigua Motorsports Park, about 25 miles southeast of Rochester.

high-mileage automobile has been around longer than most of our readers, with a version set it Philadelphia having appeared in a 1948 newspaper. (Even at that time, the story proved unverifiable, with the article's writer identifying it as such and passing it along only as an example of a current rumor sweeping through the community.) Since that early sighting of more than half a century ago, the legend has gone on to enthrall audience after audience as each couple of years sees it pop up anew.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Its origins are as strange as the story itself. Between 1928 and 1935, Charles Nelson Pogue, an inventor from Canada, applied for numerous patents for what he claimed was a new type of carburetor that supposedly completely vaporized gasoline before introducing it to the cylinders, thereby extracting a great deal more energy from the fuel. According to the Pogue patent description, fuel was introduced into the engine in this vaporous \"dry\" state rather than in the normal droplet-laden \"wet\" state, thus combining more readily with air, making it burn with far greater efficiency. Better combustion combined with the raising of the engine's operating temperature from 160 F to 180 F were said to be responsible for vastly improved fuel economy. So much for the techno-talk. The Pogue carburetor was touted as getting 200+ miles to the gallon. Glowing reports about this miracle of ingenuity's making a 1,879 mile trip on 14.5 gallons appeared in the May 1936 issue of Canadian Automotive Trade magazine, reports which Pogue later denied. A manager of a Winnipeg auto dealership claimed he had driven a Pogue-equipped car 217 miles on a gallon of gasoline. A different dealer principal claimed to have driven 26 miles on a pint of fuel. The story snowballed onward from those breathless testimonials as one rumor quickly followed on the heels of another. Thieves were reputed to have broken into Pogue's shop and made off with three of his carburetors. There was talk of armed guards and wolfhounds guarding the shop and the now-famous inventor. Wealthy backers (from Winnipeg or Toronto, depending on whom you heard the story from) were rumored to be bankrolling Pogue, but the arrangements mysteriously fell through. Ford of Canada was said to have bought the invention outright. All in all it was a very exciting time. Alas, one can get by on mere smoke and mirrors for only so long. Those with sense enough to not be deafened by the hyperbole were not long kept at bay with tales of wolfhounds, thieves, and mysterious briefcase-toting moneymen. They wanted to see the carburetor. That, of course, was never permitted. No one reputable was allowed to see the mechanical miracle in action, let alone have a chance to measure its results. After the initial excitement over Pogue's 1936 announcement had faded, more serious types began to openly doubt that the carburetor would work as described. In the December 1936 issue of Automotive Industries magazine, its engineering editor, P.M. Heldt, said of a sketch of the Pogue carburetor: \"The sketch fails to show any features hitherto unknown in carburetor practice, and absolutely gives no warrant for crediting the remarkable results claimed.\" Other journalists were beginning to voice similar opinions. In response to calls to put up or shut up, Pogue's miracle carburetor was heard of no more. Faced with the choice of believing someone had made claims his invention couldn't later live up to or that a monied bad guy had bought up a technology to forever keep it off the market, at least some chose to believe the suppression theory. That the carburetor never made it to the public, they said, was proof enough of its existence. Those 1930s news stories breathlessly trumpeting Pogue's miracle of technology form the basis of the economical carburetor legend now before us. As gas prices fluctuate, our dependence on fossil fuels is driven home time and again. Who wouldn't long for a miracle of engineering that would free us from the tyranny of the gas pump? And thus the groundwork for belief is laid. As sometimes happens in the world of urban legends, desire for something to be true transforms a rumor into certainty that this very thing is fact. Over the years, our legend about a 200 mpg car has bobbed to the surface in community after community, been debunked in numerous respected publications, and bobbed right back up in the wake of those debunkings. The need to believe in this wondrous technology and the evil car manufacturers who are deliberately withholding it from the market appears too strong to combat. A bit of rational thought should be all that's needed to lay this legend to rest. Why would the car manufacturers at all care about keeping such a technological advance away from consumers? Unlike the petroleum companies, they've no vested interest in how much fuel a car uses. An automaker's self interest is best served by getting the newest irresistible technology to the consumer before his competitors do. If any one of them possessed the secret of the 200 mpg car, he'd have rushed it into production, hoping to beat his competitors to the punch. Those who are tempted to believe the Evil Government is responsible for keeping this miracle out of our hands should reflect for a moment on the current state of world politics. The government of the United States would like nothing better than to throw off the yoke of dependence upon foreign oil. A miraculous carburetor would grant that freedom, allowing Americans to continue to enjoy current levels of use without the need to go hat in hand to OPEC or even those dastardly Canadians. The domestic supply would be more than enough. Though rarely is this tale told about anything other than a gas-miserly carburetor, this version describes a miraculous lightbulb: It was around 1920, shortly after he had married, when the old man originally purchased the light bulb from a small store in town. It appeared to be a normal light bulb. However, when after sixty years it was still going strong, he decided to write to the manufacturers and tell them of this remarkable phenomenon. By return a reply came from the company indicating that they were very interested in the bulb and would like to send someone to see it. Eventually, one of the directors of the firm called and, instead of just showing interest, offered to buy it for 1,000. The old man, of course, refused, as the light bulb had given him good service. However, his curiousity was certainly aroused why so much money for his light bulb? The director could provide no plausible explanation as to why they were willing to offer so much for the bulb, so the old man decided to explore this mystery further. With the help of a solicitor friend he did a little investigating and discovered that in the 1920s this particular light-bulb manufacturer had bought and tested the patent for an everlasting bulb. Only a few of these bulbs were made and the company, finding the invention worked, destroyed the bulbs and suppressed the idea after all, it would have put them out of business. Unknown to the company one of the lights had accidentally become mixed up with a batch of ordinary bulbs and this was the light bulb which had lit the old man's kitchen for the past sixty years. (Sometimes lore collides with reality: A long-lived light bulb has been burning since 1901 and currently lights a fire station in Livermore, California.)

(as well as a nice pension, etc.). So he is given permission to select a car from the lot there at the factory. He selects a Chevrolet Caprice, a big, luxury car. After receiving it, he is satisfied with his choice. After all, who wouldn't enjoy driving around in a roomy, comfortable car. After driving it for a while, he noticed something quite odd ... a car like this usually consumes a substantial amount of fuel, but the gas gauge hardly moves at all. After a few weeks, he gets suspicious. Things like this don't happen. Being the company man he is, he returns it to the factory. Explaining this to the service tech must've caused some strange looks, but they took it in anyway. After he got his car back, he noticed it got the typical gas mileage of a comparable car. Could've this car had some secret \"modifications\" that allowed him to drive for weeks, on the same tank of gas? Detroit's automakers have purportedly seized, er.. bought out patents of items that improve gasoline mileage like the 100 mpg carburetor, etc. Maybe the R&D department at GM put this theory to practice, and this was an example. [Collected via e-mail, 1997] A couple journeys from Western Canada to Detroit to buy a new car and presumably save shipping costs while having a vacation in the States at the same time. Driving back to the prairies, they find to their astonishment that the gas gauge is not moving down to \"empty\" even though they've been driving for hours. Arriving home some thousands of miles away from Detroit, they have only refilled the tank once or twice. A few days after returning, the husband looks out at his driveway in the morning to find two mysterious men tinkering with his car (the hood is up). Running out, they race off; he checks under the hood, finds nothing amiss, and concludes it's just vandals or would-be thieves whom he was fortunate to apprehend before any damage was done. BUT, when they drive the car, they find their gas mileage is now normal. Variations: The miraculous car legend ends one of four ways: Mysterious men appear and tinker with the engine, rendering the car no different than any other. The car is reclaimed by the factory. If the owner afterwards gets the same car back (sometimes it's replaced outright with another vehicle), it now gets ordinary gas mileage. No-nonsense business types show up to make a fabulous offer for the car, which is accepted. The owner wakes up one morning to find the car vanished without a trace.", "Last Updated": "26 June 2014", "Credibility": "false", "URL": "www.snopes.com/autos/business/carburetor.asp", "Claim": "A miraculous car that gets 200 miles to the gallon is sold by mistake then reclaimed by the factory and is never seen again.", "Claim_ID": "autos_business_carburetor", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/autos/business/carburetor.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.facebook.com", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/snopes/posts/462833697194488", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.toledoblade.com", "link": "http://www.toledoblade.com/Opinion/2008/12/09/Miracle-carburetor-legend-still-gets-mileage.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.lxsh.club", "link": "http://www.lxsh.club/200+MPG+Carburetor+Blueprints.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "ideas.businesxxl.com", "link": "http://ideas.businesxxl.com/business-ideas-on-fuel/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "cars-onlines.com", "link": "http://cars-onlines.com/200mpg-cars/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "blog.hemmings.com", "link": "http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2007/05/01/big-oil-conspiracy-376-mpg-opel-uncovered/comment-page-1/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.vimeoinfo.com", "link": "http://www.vimeoinfo.com/video/55048655/nobodys-fuel", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.bbc.com", "link": "http://www.bbc.com/news/special/2014/newsspec_8703/index.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "gas2.org", "link": "http://gas2.org/2009/07/13/students-build-hydrogen-vehicle-that-gets-1336-mpg/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Archives/Science/2010_October_23", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.encyclopedia.com", "link": "http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Greece.aspx", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.mpoweruk.com", "link": "http://www.mpoweruk.com/history.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.imdb.com", "link": "http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0034093/quotes", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "reneweconomy.com.au", "link": "http://reneweconomy.com.au/2015/toyota-vs-tesla-can-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles-compete-with-evs-60374", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "link": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3106032/Speak-like-Tarzan-don-t-embarrassed-aim-make-200-mistakes-day-Irish-polyglot-reveals-learn-language-just-three-months.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.orange-papers.org", "link": "http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-propaganda.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "helloreverb.com", "link": "https://helloreverb.com/share/interest/Automotive%20Industries", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "fallout.wikia.com", "link": "http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:Will_Civilization_and_the_World_build_back_to_the_old_days_and_be_back_to_normal_again%3F", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.princeton.edu", "link": "https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/browse/term-graph.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "e360.yale.edu", "link": "http://e360.yale.edu/content/digestlist.msp/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "granta.com", "link": "http://granta.com/second-nature/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.wesjones.com", "link": "http://www.wesjones.com/sugar1.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.antipope.org", "link": "http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2015/12/science-fictional-shibboleths.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.thecoolhunter.net", "link": "http://www.thecoolhunter.net/cloud/view/Vilnius", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "benfry.com", "link": "http://benfry.com/writing/treemap/equator.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.scribd.com", "link": "https://www.scribd.com/doc/3247883/diccionario-ingles-espanol", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "Many a product has gone through the life cycle of development, marketing, and then eventual obsolescence when its manufacturer determined it no longer sold well enough to justify continued production or decided to focus on offering a newer and better version. Upon occasion, however, a discontinued product has retained a strong enough following among a devoted group of aficionados for another company to venture licensing or purchasing the rights from the original manufacturer and resuming production. (One example of this phenomenon occurred when INTV bought the rights to the Intellivision video game system from Mattel, selling off old inventory and then producing new consoles and game cartridges.)", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "That's the basic idea behind this tale from the original (1975) edition of The People's Almanac , about a group of disenchanted General Motors stylists who left the company and spent ten years between 1958 and 1967 cranking out a few hundred thousand copies of the discontinued 1957 model Chevrolet at a small, private plant in Illinois but the kicker is that they supposedly did all this without the knowledge, cooperation, or consent of General Motors. The story seems a fairly obvious bit of humor chock full of tongue-in-cheek jabs at the auto industry (especially evident in the closing reference to Volkswagen's supposed interest in opening a U.S. plant to produce 1973 Buick Rivieras this was written in 1975, shortly after the Riviera had also undergone a significant and much-criticized design change), but its inclusion in a reference work with no external indicator of its fictional status has led many readers in the years since to take it seriously. For those who prefer a more thorough debunking, we highlight a few of the tale's many implausibilities below: We have found no mention whatsoever of \"Ardell Malowick\" or his scheme of producing '57 Chevies in any source outside of The People's Almanac; not a single book, newspaper, or magazine article about either subject (save for those that simply reference the original People's Almanac story). We've contacted a number of vintage car clubs, including ones that specialize in Chevrolet automobiles from the 1950s, and have yet to find a single person who has owned or seen (even in photographs) one of the faux '57 Chevies, anyone who worked in a dealership that sold them, any mechanic who ever serviced one of them, or anybody employed by the plant that supposedly produced them. The phony Chevy plant in Illinois reportedly turned out 200,000 automobiles in a ten-year period that's 400 cars a week, every week, for ten years! Where did a small group former GM workers raise the capital to start up and run such a massive (and illicit) manufacturing venture, all within the space of a few months? How did the plant's owners/operators, all their employees, and all the auto dealerships engaged in selling the faux '57 Chevies account for the expenses, revenues, income, and taxes associated with a product they couldn't legally make or offer for sale? How did dealers manage to sell, without anyone's noticing, a few hundred thousand cars for which they could establish no valid history or chain of ownership, and which could not be traced by serial number or other identifier to a legitimate manufacturer? We don't know how this tale ended up being published in The People's Almanac : whether the compilers decided to include bit of drollery in the book as lark, or a prankish writer managed to slip a gag past unsuspecting editors, or a gullible researcher was taken in by a tall tale. But the story is indeed a joke, and, judging by the results, a good one at that. In honor of the 50th anniversary of the classic automobile's introduction, CARS Inc. announced in 2006 that they would begin offering newly-[re]built (from original cowls) 1957 Chevrolet convertibles.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.1957chevybody.com/;http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/buick-riviera/buick-riviera-history.shtml;http://www.57classicchevy.com/;http://www.intellivisiongames.com/history.asp;", "Example": "The 1957 Chevrolet was introduced by General Motors in late 1956, as part of their special Labor Day Sneak Preview of New Cars. The '57 Chevy sported nonfunctional tail fins and excess side trim like most American cars of that era, and it would have passed into obscurity except for the amazing popularity of the design in the years that followed. While the Chevy's competitors disappeared into the junkyards of the nation, the '57 throve, particularly the 2-door Bel-Air model. The car became a favorite of customizers in Southern California, and its popularity spread across the nation. The '57 Chevy has been almost as visible on the highways of America as the Volkswagen, particularly in California and the Midwest. In 1965, the California Department of Motor Vehicles listed 35,000 '57 Chevies on the road an astounding survival rate for an American car (although in 1957, Chevrolet enjoyed total sales of 775,000 units). No other American automobile has survived the years with equal fortitude. However, no other American automobile, with the exception of the limited-production Studebaker Avanti, has enjoyed the unique production facilities of the '57 Chevy. There have been subsequent designs for subsequent Chevrolet model years, but the '57, unlike any other American car and contrary to American industrial practice, enjoyed a manufacturer's run of 10 years. A dedicated group of ex-Chevrolet stylists and franchised used-car salesmen continued to turn out close to 200,000 1957 Chevrolets, focusing on the 2-door Bel-Air model, between the years 1957 and 1967, in a small auto assembly plant located outside Jacksonville, Ill. The enthusiasts, led by ex-General Motors stylist Ardell Malowick, quit GM in mid-1957 when it was learned, to nobody's surprise, that the 1957 design was to be scrapped in favor of the longer, lower, wider '58 Chevy, which replaced the '57's peaked fins with contoured, sublimated fins. Malowick and his associates quickly decamped and purchased their own auto assembly facilities in southern Illinois. However, Malowick was unable to finance the die molds and giant steel presses which GM and Fisher Auto Body used to construct the basic body; rather, Malowick relied on the proved European coach-building technique of pounding body shape out by hand over wooden molds, formed from fiber-glass replicas of the real thing. In this way, some of the imperfections of Fisher's mass production were eliminated. Malowick and associates knew that Chevrolet, which held all legal rights to the design, would not consent to the manufacture of '57 Chevies to compete with their '58s and subsequent models. Perhaps GM was aware, as Malowick now contends, that subsequent models could never compete with the '57 for purity of design. Because of legal restrictions, the post-1957 new '57 Chevies built by Malowick were sold as remarkably well-preserved used cars in car lots across the U.S. In the sale of these cars, Malowick enjoyed the clandestine cooperation of countless used-car merchants throughout the nation who were in sympathy with his cause. Certainly, used car dealers sought Malowick's creations with a fervor they have not displayed for any other American vehicle before or since. Malowick was able to survive financially by his relatively high wholesale price, and a low overhead provided in part by engines and chassis pirated from Chrysler warehouses in northern Illinois (accounting partially for Chrysler's bewildering stock nose dive during and immediately after their \"forward look\" phase), and from sales to special collectors and customizers, mostly in California, who were willing to pay anything for a '57 Chevy in good condition. By far Malowick's most successful model was, of course, the 2-door Bel Air with the metallic plum paint, many which can be seen on the streets of most American cities today. In 1967, Malowick was forced to close down shop because of rising costs and the rumors that General Motors was wise to his operations and was preparing legal action. Malowick has since gone into the business of manufacturing denim boots and book bags, but he is considering another automobile operation if he can locate favorable conditions, possibly in Germany. There is a rumor that the giant Volkswagen Corporation, which has thought about opening a factory in the U.S., has made overtures to Malowick regarding the 1973 Buick Riviera, another classic of American design.", "Last Updated": "9 October 2013", "Credibility": "false", "URL": "www.snopes.com/autos/dream/57chevy.asp", "Claim": "A group of former General Motors workers furtively produced 1957 Chevrolet automobiles on their own for ten years.", "Claim_ID": "autos_dream_57chevy", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/autos/dream/57chevy.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/autos/dream/dream.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/search/?q=U.S.%20soldiers%20rape%20boys%20in%20front%20of%20their%20mothers&sort=relevance&order=desc&page=64", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "twitter.com", "link": "http://twitter.com/#!/snopes/status/11289983335", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "camelopardid2.rssing.com", "link": "http://camelopardid2.rssing.com/chan-1192507/all_p1.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "xishui.co", "link": "http://xishui.co/tag/car-dealers-contoured-creations", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.9-11themotherofallblackoperations.blogspot.com", "link": "http://www.9-11themotherofallblackoperations.blogspot.com/2010_02_01_archive.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.texasmonthly.com", "link": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/o-janis/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "www.carlustblog.com", "link": "http://www.carlustblog.com/hafner.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "blog.hemmings.com", "link": "http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2012/04/24/driving-away-cancer-a-50-state-odyssey-begins/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "therealafricanhousewifehomeandaway.wordpress.com", "link": "https://therealafricanhousewifehomeandaway.wordpress.com/opinion/opinion/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "archive.org", "link": "https://archive.org/stream/The_Times_News_Idaho_Newspaper_1967_08_25/The_Times_News_Idaho_Newspaper_1967_08_25_djvu.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "archive.org", "link": "https://archive.org/stream/whitinspindle1961unse/whitinspindle1961unse_djvu.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.gizmag.com", "link": "http://www.gizmag.com/abrasive-weeding/41443/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "github.com", "link": "https://github.com/robennals/think-link/blob/master/ruby/snopesclaims.csv", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.academia.edu", "link": "http://www.academia.edu/3790697/Retro_THE_CULTURE_OF_REVIVAL", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.erudit.org", "link": "https://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/2014/v25/n1/1032799ar.pdf", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "zineweb.com", "link": "http://zineweb.com/?cat=5", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.joesherlock.com", "link": "http://www.joesherlock.com/Book-Reviews4.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "weaponsman.com", "link": "http://weaponsman.com/?cat=32&paged=9", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "ufdc.ufl.edu", "link": "http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00010883/02396", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "aebrain.blogspot.com", "link": "http://aebrain.blogspot.com/2007_12_01_archive.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.alniva.be", "link": "http://www.alniva.be/corgi/corgi_historiek.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.bibliotecapleyades.net", "link": "http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/world_order/WorldCh07-1.htm", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "This is a windfall legend, pure and simple, a tale of an ordinary Joe's being in the right place at the right time to have good fortune handed to him. We want to believe in the legendary Harley because then we can believe magic could touch any of us at any time. And in that lies the key to this legend's tellability.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Most often this legend is told about a machine inscribed \"To Elvis, Love, Priscilla,\" but sometimes the bike is said to have been a gift from Elvis to James Dean. How much was paid for it is also subject to variation; anything from $300,000 to $2.2 million has been mentioned. The buyer is either said to be the Harley-Davidson Company or Jay Leno (of \"Tonight Show\" fame). (An Elvis Presley-James Dean pairing is rather unlikely because at the time of James Dean's death in an automobile accident on 30 September 1955, neither young man was yet a major entertainment figure. The two films that propelled James Dean to stardom, Giant and Rebel Without a Cause , were released posthumously, and in September 1955 Elvis Presley was still largely a regional act, recording for a small Memphis-based record label and playing live shows around the South at venues that included high school gyms. At that point in his career, Elvis would probably not have lavished such an expensive gift on someone who was then only a relatively minor TV and film star.) Jay Leno has categorically stated his only connection with this tall tale is people asking him about it: Have you heard the story about the Rockingham County farmer who bought an old Harley-Davidson motorcycle at a yard sale and discovered \"To Elvis, Love Priscilla\" written under the seat? Then he sold it to Jay Leno, late-night talk show host, who handed over $1 million for the bike? Well, Leno has heard it. \"Yesterday, I got a call that it was an old farmer in Pennsylvania that had it,\" he said. \"Then, two weeks ago, Texas Monthly magazine called because I'd bought it from a farmer (there).\" Leno has one thing to say: \"I don't buy show-business memorabilia.\" In 2000, Leno said he had been getting a couple of calls a week for the past six to eight months about the story, which he called \"an urban fairy tale\" perpetuated, in part, by the Internet. On 22 January during that evening's airing of The Tonight Show , he once again disclaimed the rumor. Additionally, Todd Morgan, a spokesman at Graceland in Memphis, said none of the long-lost Harley stories was true. If not Leno, maybe the Harley-Davidson Company bought the bike? Nope. They've less need than anyone to buy an Elvis motorcycle now, because they already have one. A 1956 Harley-Davidson KH that belonged to The King and was purchased from Fleming Horne by Harley-Davidson in 1995 is now housed at their archive facility in Milwaukee. Elvis had other motorcycles too, five of which (four Harleys and one Honda) are at the Graceland Museum in Memphis, Tennessee. Harley-Davidson has lots of fun trying to set people straight about this legend. A 1996 newspaper article relates the difficulties they've had: First, the undead Elvis was seen all across America. A St. Louis housewife even saw the King at a movie theater here. I read that in a supermarket tabloid, so I know it's true. Now Elvis' Harley is turning up all around the USA. The King's hog brings fabulous wealth to the fan who finds it. I'm proud to say I have the Harley bike story worth the most money $4 million. That number is confirmed by the Harley-Davidson folks. I heard the story from my friend Richard, who believes it is true. \"This could only happen in America,\" he said. Here is Richard's story: \"This friend of a friend of my daughter was riding along a back road, when he saw an old motorcycle for sale,\" Richard said. \"It was a 1950s Harley for $600. The bike needed work, but he bought it. \"He couldn't get parts, the bike was so old. So he called Harley headquarters in Milwaukee. He described the Harley. He kept getting transferred from person to person. Each time, they'd ask what the Harley looked like. \"Finally, the CEO of Harley came on the line. He asked the guy to describe the Harley again. Then he told him to go out and check under the rear fender. That's where he found an inscription beginning, 'To Elvis ...' \"It was Elvis' Harley-Davidson, a gift from somebody. Harley offered him $4 million for it. \"Imagine that,\" Richard said. \"Four million dollars for a bike he found by the road. It's like winning the lottery.\" Is there a chance in a million that this story is true? Elvis collectibles go for major money. His 1969 American Express card was auctioned for $41,400. And it was expired. Elvis only held it in his hand. Think what you could get for something he'd wrapped his legs around. Elvis did ride Harleys, and he rode them hard. Lamar Fike, a member of the Memphis Mafia Elvis' entourage says he and Elvis used to ride their Harleys 110 miles an hour on what is now Elvis Presley Boulevard. One misty afternoon in 1957, they had to slow down for a bus. Lamar and his Harley slid under the bus. Lamar was lucky. He only lost some leather off his jacket. He lived to tell this story to Alanna Nash for her book, Elvis Aaron Presley. Elvis' Harley was untouched. Was it the one Richard's friend of a friend found on a back road? Richard tried to find the new Harley millionaire for me. \"He was the friend of other friends,\" Richard said. \"Nobody knows his name.\" If I just got $4 million, I'd keep my name quiet, too. Richard was sure Harley-Davidson would remember this high-priced buy. I called Harley headquarters in Milwaukee and got transferred from person to person, just like the guy in the story. I didn't end up with the Harley CEO. I got Nola Vander Meulen with Harley public relations. \"We've received so many calls on the Elvis Harley,\" she said. Is the story true? \"No, it's an urban legend. We hear about it all the time, from all over. Usually the Harley is found in a barn or bought at a garage sale. The buyer lifts up the seat or looks at the fender and sees this inscription: 'To Elvis, from Priscilla.' Most stories say we buy it for anywhere from half a million to a million dollars. You came up with the most money.\" There is some truth to the tale. \"We did purchase Elvis' very own personal Harley,\" Nola said. \"But it belonged to a collector who knew what it was. The bike was well documented.\" How much did Harley pay for it? \"I don't know, and if I did, I couldn't say.\" Four million dollars? I asked. Nola laughed and laughed, which I took for a no. The Harley bike story does skid by the truth. But the actual facts are a King-sized disappointment. The legendary Elvis deserves better. I can only hope that somewhere there is an undiscovered Harley. I'll ask Elvis, next time he's in town to see a movie. A similar tale circulates concerning country singer Hank Williams, who died of a heart attack on New Year s Day of 1953 while sleeping in the back seat of his Cadillac: A guy is walking alone one night and sees a parked car with a man passed out in the backseat. The window is unrolled and the man manages to swipe the backseat sleeper's large white hat. The next morning he hears that Hank Williams was found dead in the backseat of a car. The man flips the hat upside-down only to notice the letters \"H.W.\" inscribed in the rim. Hank Williams's hat was never found and to this day it sits in this guy's closet. (Though the Elvis Harley tale isn't one of them, some windfall legends turn out to be true. One bargain hunter struck pay dirt when he bought a painting for $4 at the local flea market.

There's something about cars and solid rocket fuel engines that draws them to this tale like happy moths to an unforgiving flame. Maybe it's the Wile E. Coyote-ness of it all, the \"so real you can almost touch it\" mental image of a smoldering wreck sticking out of a cliff face. Perhaps it's the vicarious enjoyment of a Tim Allen-ish \"More Power!\" fantasy carried to its fatal yet hilarious conclusion. Or maybe it's a simple matter of cars and the men who love them, the eternal love affair.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Whatever. The boys love it, and that's all that matters. This tale of vehicular velocity ferocity has been popular among servicemen since the late 1970s. In those early word-of-mouth versions, the JATO was taken from a cargo plane or out of a warehouse on base, thereby answering a key question left up in the air in later versions: Where did the intrepid lad obtain the engine? The story is even older than that. One of our readers says he heard it in 1961 or 1962. In that version, two JATO units mounted as \"lakers\" (exhaust pipes) on a 1940 Ford were fired on Bayshore freeway while trying to outrun the California Highway Patrol. The car was last seen going end over end across San Francisco bay. Another reader heard it in 1964 while stationed at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. In that version, the unmanned JATO'd car went airborne and smashed into a tree, destroying both car and plant. The version we now know and love (complete with puzzled police and the smoldering wreck of what's left of a car impacted into the face of a cliff), began making the cyberspatial rounds in 1990. In 1992 the incident was said to have happened in New Mexico, with the car being a Plymouth Road Runner. By 1994 the car had transformed itself into a Chevrolet Impala, but now the accident's venue was California. (See how these things mutate over time?) 1995 saw this legend just about take over the Internet as it was flashed from e-mail to e-mail as \"this year's Darwin Award winner.\" It's this version which is still in circulation today, the car frozen in time as a Chevy Impala, the location given as somewhere in Arizona. As it appeared in 1995: \"Darwin award\" Nominee: You all know about the Darwin awards it's an annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way. Last year's winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke(tm) machine, which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it. And for this year's nominee, the story is: The Arizona (U.S.) Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road, on the outside of a curve. The wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it was a car. The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene. The boys in the lab finally figured out what it was, and what had happened. It seems that a guy had somehow got hold of a JATO unit, (Jet Assisted Take Off, actually a solid-fuel rocket) that is used to give heavy military transport planes an extra `push' for taking off from short airfields. He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert, and found a long, straight stretch of road. Then he attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, got up some speed, and fired off the JATO!! Best as they could determine, he was doing somewhere between 250 and 300 mph (350-420kph) when he came to that curve ... The brakes were completely burned away, apparently from trying to slow the car. TODAY'S LESSON: Solid-fuel rockets don't have an 'off' switch . . . Nor, so it seems, do good stories. A spokesman of the Arizona Department of Public Safety stated in a 1996 newspaper article the JATO story wasn't true though they continued to get asked about it. \"We get a call on that about every 90 days,'' said Dave Myers. ''It keeps us on the map.'' There are two fatal problems with the JATO story. First, anybody who understood the extreme forces involved well enough to attach a JATO unit to a car so that it would keep the car going in a straight line (rather than immediately spinning around) would probably know better than to do it in the first place. Second, the Arizona Highway Patrol has a phone number. A call to them will confirm they've both heard the story and no, it's not true. Sorry, fellas. Though the legend of the smoldering Chevy smashed into a cliff face is pure fabrication, JATO engines have been mounted on cars on a couple of occasions. As reported in Motor Trend in 1957, Dodge took a brand-new car out to El Mirage dry lake bed in California, removed the gas tank, and mounted a JATO unit in its place. (The intent was to test the car's brakes and to film the event for TV commercials.) The car went 140 mph. Barbara \"cliff unhanger\" Mikkelson", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "", "Example": "[Collected on the Internet, 1995] The Arizona Highway Patrol were mystified when they came upon a pile of smoldering wreckage embedded in the side of a cliff rising above the road at the apex of a curve. The metal debris resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it turned out to be the vaporized remains of an automobile. The make of the vehicle was unidentifiable at the scene. The folks in the lab finally figured out what it was, and pieced together the events that led up to its demise. It seems that a former Air Force sergeant had somehow got hold of a JATO (Jet Assisted Take-Off) unit. JATO units are solid fuel rockets used to give heavy military transport airplanes an extra push for take-off from short airfields. Dried desert lakebeds are the location of choice for breaking the world ground vehicle speed record. The sergeant took the JATO unit into the Arizona desert and found a long, straight stretch of road. He attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, accelerated to a high speed, and fired off the rocket. The facts, as best as could be determined, are as follows: The operator was driving a 1967 Chevy Impala. He ignited the JATO unit approximately 3.9 miles from the crash site. This was established by the location of a prominently scorched and melted strip of asphalt. The vehicle quickly reached a speed of between 250 and 300 mph and continued at that speed, under full power, for an additional 20-25 seconds. The soon-to-be pilot experienced G-forces usually reserved for dog-fighting F-14 jocks under full afterburners. The Chevy remained on the straight highway for approximately 2.6 miles (15-20 seconds) before the driver applied the brakes, completely melting them, blowing the tires, and leaving thick rubber marks on the road surface. The vehicle then became airborne for an additional 1.3 miles, impacted the cliff face at a height of 125 feet, and left a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the rock. Most of the driver's remains were not recovered; however, small fragments of bone, teeth, and hair were extracted from the crater, and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel.", "Last Updated": "12 November 2006", "Credibility": "false", "URL": "www.snopes.com/autos/dream/jato.asp", "Claim": "The remains of a smoldering JATO-equipped Chevrolet Impala were found embedded in the side of a cliff in the Arizona desert.", "Claim_ID": "autos_dream_jato", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/autos/dream/jato.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JATO_Rocket_Car", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "darwinawards.com", "link": "http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin1995-04.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.fictionresource.com", "link": "http://www.fictionresource.com/sgaurban/legends.php?search=url&value=autos", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.pistonheads.com", "link": "http://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&t=753096&d=10864.52426&nmt=", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "riko.setiaku.co", "link": "http://riko.setiaku.co/video-jato.xhtml", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.proxywhore.com", "link": "http://www.proxywhore.com/invboard/index.php?showtopic=292723&st=45", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "esmuy.mx", "link": "http://esmuy.mx/?query=%20Jato%20&lang=mx-MX", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.tomatopages.com", "link": "http://www.tomatopages.com/folsomforum/index.php?showtopic=22687", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "letschatmusic.com", "link": "http://letschatmusic.com/get/124971404/dream-map-myth.html", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "musickade.com", "link": "http://musickade.com/mp3/music-jato", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "forums.autosport.com", "link": "http://forums.autosport.com/topic/195542-acme-jet-powered-railroad-car-co/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.jbslemmer.com", "link": "http://www.jbslemmer.com/darwins.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "musikalisch.net", "link": "http://musikalisch.net/download/mp3/a-carmageddon-christmas.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "wichitascca.org", "link": "http://wichitascca.org/pipermail/wichita-scca_wichitascca.org/2009-January/004402.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "wellequipped.blogspot.com", "link": "http://wellequipped.blogspot.com/2006_12_01_archive.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "infinityoverzero.wordpress.com", "link": "https://infinityoverzero.wordpress.com/tag/jato/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.teamshelby.com", "link": "http://www.teamshelby.com/forums/index.php/topic/39298-the-mother-of-all-mods/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.topaks.ir", "link": "http://www.topaks.ir/key/jaton-corporation/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.goftavard.ga", "link": "http://www.goftavard.ga/c/JATO/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "m00cow007.tripod.com", "link": "http://m00cow007.tripod.com/id2.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.funny.co.uk", "link": "http://www.funny.co.uk/real-life/the-darwin-awards-a-complete-archive/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.tumblr.com", "link": "https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/ground-vehicle", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "humour.bluehaze.com.au", "link": "http://humour.bluehaze.com.au/show.php?wk=2015_10_09", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.seanet.com", "link": "http://www.seanet.com/~owenmp/cwin/is0108.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "forum.pl-vacc.org", "link": "http://forum.pl-vacc.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=3895", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "michalnezamyka.warthogterritory.net", "link": "http://michalnezamyka.warthogterritory.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=5502&p=44745", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "forums.plentyoffish.com", "link": "https://forums.plentyoffish.com/usermessages.aspx?user_Id=989939", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.crusher-mining.com", "link": "http://www.crusher-mining.com/wiki/impala-mining-plants.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.findeen.es", "link": "http://www.findeen.es/jatp,1.html", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "Judging from the entries made on one police blotter after another, cars around the nation are having their gas tanks sugared by those whom their owners have displeased. Why is this happening? Because, according to widespread belief, sugar poured into a gas tank will turn into a poor man's version of liquid cement and quickly render the vehicle's engine unfit for anything but a junkyard. In theory, the sugar dissolves into the gasoline, then travels along the fuel lines into the engine, where the heat of the vehicle's operations melts the sweetener into a dense sludge that gets into every nook and cranny of the engine. The sucrosed engine seizes and halts the vehicle in its tracks, but the real damage comes when the engine cools and the sludge hardens to rock-like consistency. Only the replacement of the entire engine will render the car fit for use again, says popular wisdom; otherwise, it's kiss your jalopy goodbye.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "It is for such reason that this theory is so fervently cherished it appears to grant, for the price of a 5 lb. bag of sugar, the ability to effect great and irreparable harm to an adversary's most prized possession. The touted mode of vengeance is both inexpensive and easy to carry out, a combination that seems to put the power of getting even into the hands of anyone, no matter how disadvantaged. However, revenge fantasies aside, this snippet of popular lore turns out not to be the sure and deadly car killer the retribution-minded would want to believe it is. As with many grand schemes, it lives more vividly in its imagining than in reality. Sugar doesn't dissolve in gasoline, as a researcher at Berkeley confirmed in 1994. Forensics professor John Thornton labeled sucrose with radioactive carbon atoms and mixed it with gasoline, then spun the concoction in a centrifuge. After the undissolved particles were removed, the liquid's radiation level was measured to determine how much sucrose had become part of the gasoline. The answer was extremely little: the equivalent of less than a teaspoonful per 15-gallon tank of gas. Because sugar doesn't dissolve in automotive fuel, it doesn't carmelize, and so it does not turn into the debilitating gunk this well-known entry in the revenge canon calls for. Instead, sugar poured into a car's gas tank stays intact. While sugar could still cause harm if it reached the engine (but in the same way sand would, by virtue of its being a granular contaminant, not because the sugar would turn into a syrup), even that potential harm is generally prevented by filtration. At the end of the pickup tube in the gas tank is a \"sock\" that blocks solid materials, so the fuel gets through, but precious little that's not liquid does. Further up the line is the fuel filter, and what may have got through the \"sock\" does not get past it. Yet, even though the sugar will not reach the engine in either syrup or solid state, it can clog the fuel filter or the fuel injectors, a circumstance which could stop a car. A little sugar in the tank could be dealt with by no more than having to change the fuel filter a few times, but a heavier sugaring would require the gas tank be removed from the car and dumped out. Tom and Ray Magliozzi (the hosts of radio's Car Talk ) say it's not a big job for a good mechanic to drop the tank and clean it out; the process would likely cost the car's owner somewhere between $100 and $200. Though $100 to $200 is an appreciable sum, it is a far cry from the wished-for outcome of forcing the victim to have to replace the engine or scrap the car. Ironically, there may soon come a day when each of us happily puts sugar in our gas tanks. In 2002 researchers at the University of Wisconsin at Madison happened upon a relatively easy way to extract hydrogen from a glucose solution: heat the sugar solution to 392 F and pass it over a platinum-based catalyst to break it down into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The resultant hydrogen could then be directed into a fuel cell that would power a car, with the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. The potential for using sugar to fuel cars doesn't end with the notion of using the hydrogen extracted from glucose solutions. In 2004 researchers at Sandia National Labs began applying for patents covering ways to convert the glucose itself into energy, with an eye to using the sugar itself as a fuel source. Yet the science of the matter aside, we expect reports of sugared gas tanks to continue to appear on police blotters everywhere for as long as gasoline engines power cars. The desire for revenge runs strong so strong that it will not let such a little thing as facts get in its way. Accordingly, the best way to gain revenge on someone through the \"sugar in the gas tank\" prank might be to simply play on the belief rather than the reality just sprinkle a fair amount of sugar on the ground beneath the opening to the fuel tank of your victim's car and leave an empty sugar sack in a conspicious spot near the vehicle. Then sit back and watch your victim go wild trying to figure out how to deal with all that sugar he assumes is now in his gas tank.

on the Internet in 1999. Though both versions of the original Internet warning alluded to an accident in Indonesia wherein a driver was burned and his car badly damaged as a result of such an explosion, no reports ever surfaced in the news media to confirm the incident. Moreover, nothing turned up about similar explosions in other countries. If sparks from cell phones were touching off conflagrations at gas pumps around the world, as suggested at the time, the phenomenon escaped the media's notice. Such rumors were furthered in May 1999 when a lengthy article appeared in the Bangkok Post supporting this warning. It mentioned \"a recent report in the China Post newspaper\" and from there proceeded to parrot the warning given in the longer example quoted above, complete with reference to the report by Shell Chemicals on the injuries suffered by the man in Indonesia and the Chinese Petroleum Corporation's instructions to filling stations to get drivers to switch off their phones while fueling.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Okay, so the bit about a guy in Indonesia being turned into a human fireball didn't stand up. But what about persistent rumors concerning another supposed victim, this time an Australian man, supposedly done in by using his mobile phone as he refueled? Although in 1999 oil companies told the South China Morning Post they had heard reports of an Australian man being blown up recently when his phone rang as he was filling his car with gasoline, fire service heads in Australia insist the incident never happened. As for incidents elsewhere in the world, after several reports were circulated in the United States claiming mobile phones had been blamed for fires at gas stations, both the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) and the American Petroleum Institute issued statements denying the risk. The CTIA said, \"There is no evidence whatsoever that a wireless phone has ever caused ignition or explosion at a station anywhere in the world. Wireless phones don't cause gas stations to blow up. Warnings being posted in petrol stations simply perpetuate the myth.\" The American Petroleum Institute said, \"We can find no evidence of someone using a cellphone causing any kind of accident, no matter how small, at a gas station anywhere in the world.\" In June 2002 another authoritative-sounding warning on this subject began circulating on the Internet: The Shell Oil Company recently issued a warning about three incidents where Mobile Phones have ignited fumes while being answered or ringing during fueling operations. What specifically happened Case 1 The phone was placed on the car's trunk lid during fueling, it rang and the ensuing fire destroyed the car and the gasoline pump. Case 2 An individual suffered severe burns to their face when fumes ignited as they answered a call while refueling their car. Case 3 An individual suffered burns to the thigh and groin as fumes ignited when the phone, which was in their pocket, rang while they were fueling their car. What should you learn from this? It is a misconception that Mobile Phones are intrinsically safe and can't ignite fuel/fumes. Mobile phones that light up when switched on, or when they ring, have enough energy released to provide a spark for ignition. Mobile phones should not be used in filling stations, or when fueling lawn mowers, boats etc. Mobile phones should not be used around other materials that generate flammable or explosive fumes or dust (i.e. solvents, chemicals, gases, grain dust etc.). Mobile phones should be turned off before entering an area where other materials that generate flammable or explosive fumes or dust is located. Please share this with employees who do not have access to email, family members and friends to help keep everyone safe. Though we looked long and hard, we never found documentation confirming any of the three incidents described in the that warning. Moreover, Shell denied having issued a warning of this nature: We understand that there is an email, purportedly official Shell communication, circulating which describes various incidents that are supposed to have occurred as a result of mobile phones ringing while at a retail station. Please be advised that the email in question does NOT originate from Shell Malaysia and we are unable to confirm any of the incidents quoted. There was a warning memo which originated at a Shell loading station in California, but it was issued only to caution employees about the potential dangers of static-related hazards at fueling stations; it said nothing about cell phones touching off fires. (The \"three incidents\" e-mail quoted above was teamed with a separate warning about the hazards posed by static electricity, a topic covered on our Static Quo page.) Okay, so it hasn't happened yet. Is there still a potential, as yet unrealized risk in using cell phones while refueling? According to some experts, there is a danger that using a mobile phone near gas pumps could touch off an explosion, but not only have we found no real-life instances of such an explosion occurring, we don't know anyone who has demonstrated experimentally that it's even possible (including the folks at The Discovery Channel's Mythbusters program). Even so, gas pumps in Australia bear stickers cautioning motorists to turn off their phones while refueling; Shell in Malaysia has affixed similar stickers to each of its gas pumps; numerous pumps in the U.S.A. are similarly adorned; Canada's major gas pump operators have banned customers from using mobile phones while at the gas pump; and in 1999 the city of Cicero, Illinois, passed the first law in the USA banning the use of cellular phones at gas stations. All of this activity was in the nature of CYA cautions rather than a response to a documented hazard. Cellular phone manufacturers Nokia and Ericsson have said the risk is very small that something will happen when one uses a cell phone at a gas station, but since there is a risk, it should be counted. Nokia also said that the company has been recommending for a long time that mobile phones should be turned off while the car is being refueled. What it is about a cellular phone that could possibly trigger an explosion is difficult to fathom, however. The claim that the batteries used in a cellular phone can ignite gasoline seems specious, since cellular phone batteries are the same voltage as automobile batteries (12V D.C.) but deliver far less current. Likewise, the claim that a \"cellular phone ringer uses more than 100 volts for excitation\" is a curious artifact of the \"regular\" telephone era: cellular phones don't have ringers; they produce audio tones that simulate the sound of a ringing telephone. News reports routinely attribute gas pump fires to cell phone use whenever a fire occurs at a service station where such a phone was in use at the time, and police and firefighters at the scene often simply assume the connection between the two to be valid. Later investigations, however, have always shown in such cases that the press reports were wrong, that something else (usually a discharge of static electricity) touched off the fires, and the presence of cell phones was coincidental rather than causal.

All the electronic devices in gas stations are protected with explosive containment devices, (intrinsically safe) while cell phones are not. READ YOUR HANDBOOK! Mobile phone makers Motorola, Ericsson, and Nokia, all print cautions in their user handbooks that warn against mobile phones in \"gas stations, fuel storage sites, and chemical factories.\" Exxon has begun placing \"warning stickers\" at its gasoline stations. The threat mobile phones pose to gas stations and their users is primarily the result of their ability to produce sparks that can be generated by the high-powered battery inside the phone. Please pass this on. [Collected on the Internet, 1999] *** PASS THIS ON TO ALL YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS *** Mobile phones an explosive risk at gas stations. Switch off your mobile phone while filling your car. This is the latest advice for mobile phone users and gas station attendants alike from the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), which has recently informed all its affiliates to be on alert for people chatting on mobiles while pumping gas, a practice it asserts can cause explosions. \"There have been several explosions in Southeast Asia and Europe and we hope similar tragedies can be avoided in Taiwan,\" said David Tung from CPC's main engineering division. According to a report released by Shell Chemicals, a driver in Indonesia suffered burns and his car was severely damaged when petrol vapor exploded after being ignited by static electricity from the mobile phone he was using. Apparently, the driver had been talking on a mobile phone as a gas station attendant filled his car with petrol. When the driver bent down close to the petrol tank to check whether it was full, the vapor exploded. In Belgium, customers have been prohibited from using mobile phones within 10 meters of gas stations and warnings are posted everywhere to remind people of the danger, according to a Belgian newspaper. The threat mobile phones pose to gas stations and their users around the world is largely due to their ability to produce sparks. These can be generated by the high-powered battery inside the phone, which is itself, a possible cause of fire. But the electromagnetic waves emitted by the phone are more than sufficient to create considerable static electricity that heats the surrounding air and if the flammable vapor is concentrated enough, causes an explosion. But other electronic devices installed in the gas stations are safe. \"All the electronic devices in gas stations are protected with explosive containment devices, while cellular phones are not,\" Tung explained. Mobile phone makers Motorola, Ericsson and Nokia, all print cautions in their user handbooks that warn against mobile phones in \"gas stations, fuel storage sites and chemical factories.\" But the danger is still being ignored by many users who continue to talk on their cellular phones while filling up at gas stations. \"Asking them to turn off the phone is the only thing we can do now, but not all the users like to : some of them even get mad with me,\" one attendant at a gas station complained. In fact, if danger is to be avoided, all transmitting devices - not just mobile phones - should be switched off near gas stations and locations housing flammable substances. Mobile phones should also be switched off near sensitive electronic equipment, in places such as hospitals and airports for public safety reasons.

They might be landmarks as considerable as a house you lived in, a school you attended, or a restaurant you frequented, or as unremarkable as a street sign, a water tank, or a tree.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "One such memory of mine is a rather unusual one. It involves a landmark that lasted only a few days before being destroyed; a landmark I never saw and was too young to be aware of during its short lifespan. Nonetheless, I grew up hearing the folklore of how it came to be and what happened to it, and studying the tantalizing remnant of its brief existence. The landmark of which I speak was the infamous Pink Lady, a 60-foot tall drawing of a naked woman which mysteriously appeared overnight on a sheer rock cliff above a tunnel on Malibu Canyon Road (one of several canyon passageways through the Santa Monica Mountains connecting the northwest portion of Los Angeles County to the Pacific coast) in October 1966: The Pink Lady was the handiwork of Lynne Seemayer (now Lynne Westmore), a 31-year-old secretary from Northridge, California. Motivated in part by the ugly graffiti adorning the rocks above and around a tunnel four miles north of Malibu \"[T]he tunnel was an eyesore,\" she said. \"If someone was going to that trouble, why not do something creative?\" Ms. Seemayer spent several months planning her art project and preparing her \"canvas.\" Starting in January 1966, she whiled away several nights each month (on evenings when the full moon provided adequate light) climbing the cliff and, tethered by nylon ropes, erasing the graffiti. Finally, by August 1966, the cliff face was sufficiently graffiti-free for her to sketch an outline of her planned drawing, which remained undisturbed (and largely unnoticed) for another two months. (She had originally hoped to draw a bird, but after she realized that its wings would be obstructed by brush she opted for the more vertical figure of a woman instead.) Finally, at 8:00 PM on Friday, 28 October 1966 (another moonlit night), Seemayer began her final assault on the Lynne Seemayer Westmore cliff with brushes and paint cans. By dawn, she had completed her work: a 60-foot-tall painting of a naked, pink-skinned, large-breasted woman with long flowing hair, captured in a running pose with a batch of flowers clutched in her right hand. For the first two days of her existence, the Pink Lady (as she was quickly dubbed) was mostly known only to those who glimpsed her while traveling northbound on Malibu Canyon Road. But by Monday word of the mysterious, titillating image had spread, and by Tuesday the Pink Lady was receiving widespread coverage in local newspapers and TV newscasts. She was also deemed to be a serious traffic hazard. Foreseeing potential traffic jams (motorists were already stopping their cars along the road to gaze) and accidents caused by distracted drivers, Los Angeles county officials quickly decided that the Pink Lady had to go. Early eradication efforts failed spectacularly: firefighters were unable to wash the Pink Lady away with their high-power hoses, and the liberal application of paint remover only deepened the blush of her pink skin. (Seemayer had used house paint for her creation, a substance which proved quite difficult to remove.) Only after the county's assault on the Pink Lady began did Seemayer step forward and reveal herself to be the artist behind the work. (The difficult-to-reach location and subject matter of the painting had led most observers to speculate that its creator was a man.) As the Los Angeles Times reported twenty-five years later: Westmore arrived on the scene, and was horrified. She had assumed that she would feel no sentimental attachment to the Pink Lady, but would easily forget her as with other art projects and move on to the next. But when she saw the road crew trying to erase her work, her emotionschanged. \"I usually don't have a feeling that everything I do is precious,\" Westmore said. \"But in this case, I became its mother, and it became important for me to save her. It was the most ridiculous thing I had ever seen.\" There was little Westmore could do. She had always wondered if the painting might land her in jail, and the county's response only heightened that concern. She stayed silent. Finally, when she realized the only way to stop the lady's removal was a court injunction, she went public. She appealed to [county Road Division head I. L.] Morhar to stop the proceedings. It made no difference. Neither petitions nor injunctions availed in saving the Pink Lady. On Thursday, 3 November 1966, as onlookers booed in disapproval, county workers blanked out the scarcely five-day-old Pink Lady with 14 gallons of brown paint. (The folklore that developed over the years later held that the Pink Lady had been removed only through the recourse of sandblasting her off the cliff face.) County workers paint over the Pink Lady, 3 November 1966 Although Lynne Seemayer [Westmore] saw some positive results from her efforts (art galleries, for example, quickly offered to show her work), much of the experience proved negative. She sued Los Angeles County for $1 million over the destruction of her work and the invasion of her privacy, and the county countersued for about $26,000 to recoup the cost of erasing the Pink Lady and managing the \"public nuisance\" she created. (Both lawsuits were thrown out after the court determined the Pink Lady had been painted on private property, and therefore neither party had standing to file suit.) On the Pink Lady's 25th anniversary, the Los Angeles Times chronicled some of the negative repercussions of her creation and removal: \"As I was leaving that day,\" said Westmore, who couldn't bear to watch her creation be removed, \"this woman came up to me and said, 'Let me just touch you.' That's when I knew this was starting to get out of hand.\" Another woman called Westmore every other night for two months, contending that the Pink Lady was an exact portrait of her young daughter who ran away from home. \"She thought I had used her daughter as a model,\" Westmore said. \"It was so pathetic. She was so convinced.\" Westmore received hate mail from people offended by the nude portrait, including one letter from someone threatening to tar and feather her and her two children and dump them off at Sunset Boulevard. She turned the letter over to the FBI. She received pictures of men masturbating. An arts group asked her to judge pictures that apes had painted. \"It was too crazy,\" she said. \"One woman accused me of all the rapes that had been committed, that the Pink Lady brought out the lust in men.\" Westmore changed her telephone number, but the calls kept coming. Finally, the stress was too much, and she was hospitalized with pneumonia and lost her job as a legal secretary. But even in the hospital she wasn't immune from attention. \"This nurse came in, wanting me to sign something,\" Westmore recalled. \"I thought it was for some kind of medical work, but she wanted an autograph.\" In the end, a sad result for a woman who had not sought to make a monetary profit or a grand political statement, but who had simply felt the urge to create a piece of art to \"do something that was [her] own.\" (Lynne Seemayer professed surprise at the controversy her Pink Lady created; she had even left a rope at the site so that she could go back and touch up her work later.) I never saw the unobscured version of the Pink Lady myself. My childhood landmark was an enigmatic and impenetrable blur that marked the spot where something of interest had once stood, augmented by the often inaccurate and embellished memories of those who knew the Pink Lady during her brief lifetime. Somehow that made her all the more intriguing.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "", "Example": "", "Last Updated": "17 May 2013", "Credibility": "true", "URL":

an unpleasant fact of life in Los Angeles. The burgeoning population (close to 10 million for all of Los Angeles County at last count) and the great distances traversed daily by many L.A. commuters combine to overload the area's freeway systems. One breakdown in a key lane, or even a simple fender-bender, can cause traffic to back up for miles; fatal accidents or other impediments can close vital roads for hours at a time.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Every large city has its \"traffic watch,\" complete with helicopter reporters who spot-check the local freeways and broadcast traffic conditions to commuters through a variety of drive-time radio shows, but Los Angeles is a special case. Routine traffic updates that mention the nature and severity of congestion-causing incidents can easily rush through a dizzying array of freeway names and numbers in half a minute, and woe betide the less-than-attentive motorist who misses the key update for the freeway he was planning to take on a morning when something brings traffic to a standstill on that crucial road his inattentiveness may strand him for hours. Minor accidents and slowdowns are routine and, although annoying, are considered an ordinary part of the commute. But what about the large-scale interruptions; the overturned rig sprawling across three lanes, the five-car injury wreck, the hazardous materials spill, or the bomb threat? Los Angeles has a special name for its traffic updates about unforeseen incidents that have caused what will be lengthy lane closures: SigAlerts. The official Highway Patrol definition of a SigAlert is \"any unplanned event that causes the closing of one lane of traffic for 30 minutes or more, as opposed to a planned event like road construction, which is planned separately.\" SigAlerts are issued by the California Highway Patrol and are broadcast on Los Angeles radio and television stations, posted on the CHP web site, and signaled to motorists via electronic billboards on the freeways. Sensible folks immediately divert to alternate routes when they hear the dread term \"SigAlert\" applied to the route they were planning to take. Causes of SigAlerts are many and varied; some tragic, some funny. One of the more unusual SigAlerts was the Tuesday morning in October 1998 when a truck transporting ten tons of pies overturned on the transition from the Harbor to the Hollywood freeways, creating a pastry-coated traffic snarl that stretched for miles. The word SigAlert eventually became a common and familiar term to Southland drivers, even though few of them were aware of its origins or knew what criteria triggered such an alert. (Los Angeles traffic reporters say the question they're most frequently asked is 'What's a SigAlert?,' with the second most-asked question being \"What's the No. 1 lane?\") A genuine SigAlert is called when conditions create an unplanned freeway lane blockage of at least half an hour in duration (which might not sound like much to a nonresident, but we locals know how a spilled tennis shoe in one lane of a freeway can tie up everyone for hours). Since nearly everyone knew that the term 'SigAlert' announced major freeway congestion, and the name sounded official, most drivers who gave it any thought simply assumed the word was a shortening of \"signal alert.\" Other attempts to fathom what the \"Sig\" portion of \"SigAlert\" referred to produced some amusing entries, our favorite being the guess that it was an acronym formed from the advisory phrase \"stay in garage.\" It was a minor mystery that baffled many Los Angelenos for years, as the New York Times noted in 1997: \"When I was doing traffic I got more questions about 'What the hell is a Sigalert?' than anything else,\" said Bill Keane, who pioneered radio traffic reporting on KNX and retired in 1993, after 37 years on the air and who is credited with helping popularize the term. \"But nobody knew just where it came from. It got really big in the mid-70's.\" The answer is that SigAlerts gained their name from the man who developed the technology for speedily gathering and disseminating traffic information, Loyd C. Sigmon. In 1955, Sigmon was an executive co-owner of AM radio station KMPC in Los Angeles, part of the Golden West Broadcasting network of western radio and TV stations founded by cowboy singing star Gene Autry. Seeking a way to boost his station's ratings in the face of increasing competition from television, Sigmon came up with the idea of having the Los Angeles Police Department, who then patrolled Los Angeles freeways and dealt with accidents (functions now primarily handled by the California Highway Patrol), call his station every time a major accident occurred. Broadcasting alerts of accident-related freeway congestion to listeners, Sigmon reasoned, would give KMPC a competitive edge over both television and other local radio stations. Unfortunately, Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker rejected Sigmon's suggestion; he didn't want his officers diverted from their duties by having to phone a radio station to report every freeway accident. So Sigmon, who had served as radio engineer with the Army Signal Corps in Europe during World War II , put his ingenuity to work and created a device to automate the task. His invention was a combination of a short-wave receiver tuned to the LAPD frequency and a tape recorder when a police dispatcher broadcast an accident-related call to police units, he could push a button that activated the recorder on KMPC's receiver (by transmitting a special tone); the device would record the bulletin and then turn on a red light to signal radio engineers that an alert had been received. By rebroadcasting these bulletins, KMPC would be able to provide its listeners with traffic advisories far more up-to-the-minute than any competitor's. Although Sigmon's notification system was a technical success, it proved less of a commercial one. Chief Parker insisted that the system was too important to be used for the benefit of a single radio station and required that it be made available to everyone who wanted it. Sigmon was unable to gain the proprietary advantage he had envisioned for KMPC, nor did he ever profit personally from his invention, but Parker did give him due credit by coining the term \"SigAlert\" to describe the new high-tech traffic bulletins. SigAlerts became part of the Los Angeles driving experience by October 1955. While it is impossible at this time to pinpoint the incident that prompted the first broadcast of the traffic advisory, one of its first major uses took place on 22 January 1956, when a train leaving Los Angeles' Union Station for San Diego derailed downtown and rolled onto its side. 29 people died in that crash, and 120 were injured. Ironically, the initial SigAlert issued as a plea for emergency medical assistance drew such a heavy response that all the medical personnel rushing to the scene caused an even greater traffic jam than the train derailment itself. SigAlerts are restricted to traffic incidents these days, but in the beginning they were issued about all manner of items of concern: rabid dogs, a dam about to burst, gas leaks, and even an appeal on behalf of a druggist who had made a potentially deadly error in filling one customer's prescription. Those uses came to end after a SigAlert was issued to announce the collision of two ships in Los Angeles Harbor; at that point Police Chief Parker stepped in and announced, \"We're not going to run the traffic for the harbor.\" In 1993, the Oxford English Dictionary added \"SigAlert\" to its all-inclusive compendium of the English language, thereby signaling that it had joined \"couch potato\" as another Left Coast term to make it into the lexicon of everyday life. These days the term is no longer limited to Los Angeles or traffic conditions; its use is common in other parts of the USA, and it is often employed to stand for any type of warning or severe condition. Fortunately, Los Angeles experiences very little in the way of inclement weather, because local wisdom has it that a rainy day practically guarantees a SigAlert or three. Loyd Sigmon himself passed away at the ripe old age of 95 in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, on 2 June 2004.

Several types of devices are on the market which allow an officer, or tow truck operator, to unlock the vehicle by sliding a metal rod, commonly known as a \"slim jim\", between the door window and frame in order to access the control rods which unlock the door lock and handle. Once unlocked, the owner can enter the vehicle and retrieve the keys. Many devices have successfully been used for this purpose, including the well known coat hanger.

Inadvertent deployment of the airbag can cause the slim jim to be launched upward with great force. The force is strong enough to cause the device to penetrate the chin of the person attempting to access the vehicle, after which it can continue on to become lodged in the brain. Even when lockout assistance efforts do not prove to be deadly, the damage costs can be significant and may include thousands of dollars for replacement of the dashboard, which is designed to breakaway so as not to harm the driver or front passenger. The wiring for many of these side impact airbags is not shielded in any way, so a car opening tool can easily damage the wiring, causing malfunction or possible deployment of the airbag.Employees who find themselves in a situation where they need to get into a locked vehicle should be aware of the possible danger of deployment of the airbags for their own safety as well as the safety of others.",

"Numerous folks swear Interstate highways in the United States must be designed so that one mile in every five is perfectly straight and flat. According to this whispered bit of facetious lore, if the U.S. ever comes under attack, those straight, flat stretches will be used as landing strips.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Belief in this crazy idea should fail anyone's logic test. It makes no sense to render inoperable the Interstate highway system during times of domestic crisis moving troops and supplies on the ground would be too important an activity to curtail just to land planes. The U.S. is riddled with any number of small, private airfields that could be pressed into service if the need arose, with that need being dependent on some foreign power having first knocked out an almost uncountable number of major airports plus those airstrips on military bases, not to mention the American fleet of aircraft carriers. Folks who commit to believing this crazy notion of highways doubling by design as airstrips are letting the romance of a \"cool fact\" blind them to what their common sense should be blinking at them in bright neon letters. Richard Weingroff, information liaison specialist for the Federal Highway Administration's Office of Infrastructure and the FHA's unofficial historian, says the closest any of this came to touching base with reality was in 1944, when Congress briefly considered the possibility of including funding for emergency landing strips in the Federal Highway-Aid Act (the law that authorized designation of a \"National System of Interstate Highways\"). At no point was the idea kited of using highways or other roads to land planes on; the proposed landing strips would have been built alongside major highways, with the highways serving to handle ground transportation access to and from these strips. The proposal was quickly dropped, and no more was ever heard of it. (A few countries do use some of their roads as military air strips, however.) Some references to the one-mile-in-five assertion claim it's part of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. This piece of legislation committed the federal government to build what became the 42,800-mile Eisenhower Interstate Highway System, which makes it the logical item to cite concerning regulations about how the interstate highway system was to be laid out. The act did not, however, contain any \"one-in-five\" requirement, nor did it even suggest the use of stretches of the interstate system as emergency landing strips. The one-out-of-five rule was not part of any later legislation either.

himself as falling into that category. For this reason, we adore the notion of little easy-to-do tricks that will keep us, the occasional overindulgers, from being rounded up and tossed into the hoosegow as if we were actual miscreants who make our roads dangerous. It's not for those lawless killers who routinely get totaled then slip behind the wheel of a car, you understand. It's for us, the ordinary folk who get pulled over that one time we had a drink on our way home.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "All imaginary halos and denials aside, none of these tricks work. Pennies held in the mouth no more fool the breathalyzer than would hopping on one foot while reciting the Lord's Prayer. There's nothing magical about the presumed copper content of a one-cent piece that negates the test. (From 1982 on, the U.S. one-cent coin has been made of 97.5% zinc encased in a copper coating.) Likewise, although mints and various other breath treatments are at least somewhat effective at masking the odor of alcohol on the tippler's breath, they do nothing to affect the presence of demon rum in that person's system. In other words, even if the smell is not detectable, the alcohol itself is. Older breathalyzers measured the chemical reaction between the amount of alcohol expelled on the breath and the contents of a vial in a breathalyzer machine. Newer machines measure breath alcohol by the process of infrared absorption, which entails passing an infrared light wave through a sample chamber containing the subject's breath, then measuring the drop in the intensity of the light and using that to calculate the amount of alcohol in the subject's breath. It's important to delay the test for 20 minutes after the person being examined has had a drink else \"mouth alcohol\" might interfere with the results. (Traces of booze generally remain in the mouth for 10 to 15 minutes after a drink is taken. The 20 minute deprivation period allowed for this to dissipate.) Additionally, many police officers assert breathalyzer results can be compromised by the subject's burping while being tested (which they believe would increase the presence of mouth alcohol). That belief is more lore than science: According to a 1992 study performed at the Laboratory of Hygiene at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, belching had no effect on breathalyzer results. In one study subjects belched and blew into the instrument 15 minutes after taking a drink of alcohol; the reading was recorded then compared to another reading taken one minute later. There was no difference. Even when people would bring up a belch of gas directly into the instrument, there was no effect. Folks have done many strange things over the years in an effort to beat the machine. In a case heard in an Alberta courtroom in March 1985, 28-year-old Dave Zurfluh, who was stopped on suspicion of driving while under the influence, ate his undershorts in the belief they would soak up the excess alcohol in his system. According to Constable Bill Robinson, the arresting officer, he heard \"some ripping and tearing\" from the back of the cruiser. \"I looked in the back and he was tearing pieces of the crotch of his underwear out and stuffing them in his mouth,\" Robinson testified. We've no idea if the eating of the shorts was what got him off, but Dave Zurfluh was acquitted of all charges because he'd blown .08 on the breathalyzer, the legal limit. In March 2005 a 59-year-old accused drunk driver in Ontario tried to foil a police breathalyzer by stuffing his mouth full of feces. He had been taken to the police station for testing, where he grabbed a handful of his own waste \"and placed it in his mouth, attempting to trick the breathalyzer machine,\" said Sgt. James Buchanan of the South Simcoe Police. It didn't work. The machine registered two readings of intoxication from samples the suspect provided. Both were more than twice the legal limit. As for the \"penny\" canard, that too has been tried in real life. In August 2000, one East Hampton man pulled over for drunk driving was discovered to be sucking on a penny when approached for a breathalyzer sample. His speech was slurred, he couldn't stand up straight, and he failed all the standard sobriety tests, yet still he had faith in the \"penny under the tongue\" trick to save the day. The notion that \"smell of booze equals booze itself\" fuels the erroneous belief that breath improvers are effective counters to the breathalyzer test. Possibly in an attempt to cash in on this confusion, in 1997 a British company began marking \"Breathalyzer Blitz,\" mints advertised for their ability to rid breath of alcohol odors. The spokespeople for Blitz Design Corp. were always upfront in their denials that their mints would negate breathalyzer test results, but the name of the confection itself might well have misled many into believing these particular candies would have that effect. Also, those whose tipple of choice was Zima (a sweet colorless beverage especially favored by the younger set) were often under the mistaken impression that the booze in that particular concoction was not detectable via breathalyzer examination. Because Zima leaves little smell on the breath, its devotees concluded the alcohol contained in the beverage itself would prove similarly hard to pin down. They were wrong, of course, because Zima contained about the same amount of alcohol as ordinary beer, and the breathalyzer would always pick up on that. Yet this tidbit of lore proved surprisingly hardy and was often swapped among teens as a \"Did you know?\" revelation.

He was drunk and a cop pulled him over. He said the first thing he did was stuff a handful of pennies in his mouth and then spit them out as the officer approached the car. He said a short time later he was given a breathalizer test and because of the copper alloy residue (or whatever) the breathalizer tester went bonkers and they couldn't get an accurate evaluation and was off the hook. [Collected on the Internet, 2001] Here's something I heard a little over a year ago supposedly from a friend of a friend. At the time my friend told me that he heard that several states were trying to outlaw Icebreakers gum because it would disguise alcoholic content in breathalyzer tests and the readings would come out negative. As far as I know, Icebreakers is still being sold and I have yet to hear about a real lawsuit or a law being made to stop it.", "Last Updated": "9 April 2012", "Credibility": "false", "URL":

motorists only by following them in patrol vehicles for prescribed distances and estimating the offenders' speeds in comparison to their own. The development of radar guns allowed police to remain stationary alongside roadways and still catch speeders (as well as measuring their rate of travel more accurately). Then the advent of speed cameras (which use radar to track passing cars and automatically snap pictures of vehicles traveling in excess of speed limits) almost entirely removed humans from the process of catching speeders.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Now, many privacy advocates have been fearing that the next logical step will be the issuance of tickets to motorists who weren't actually caught in the act of speeding by either a human being or a speed-measuring device rather, drivers will be cited by \"average-speed cameras\" or \"point-to-point\" systems that track and photograph their progress between checkpoints through the use of some form of tag carried by drivers or their automobiles, record their elapsed times of passage between those checkpoints, use that information to estimate whether vehicles had to have been traveling in excess of speed limits at any portion of their journeys, and (if so) automatically issue citations. Such a scheme would prevent habitually speeding drivers from avoiding detection by learning the locations of speed traps and ordinary photo radar cameras and slowing down in their proximity. The \"camera tracking\" scenario raises concerns that citizens might have to defend themselves against citations that do not detail where, when, and by how much they were speeding, and warnings about that possibility circulated widely in 2007 (in the form of a rumor that New York would be using E-ZPass transponders or RFID chips embedded within vehicle registration stickers to catch speeders). A similar rumor was floated in mid-2009, one which claimed Florida would be replacing the call boxes along its interstate highways with cameras which would snap pictures of passing cars and issue tickets to those determined to have passed between two call boxes too quickly for the given speed limit. However, the implementation of such a system in any state is not imminent. As of June 2009 only two states in the U.S., Maryland and Arizona, were using any form of photo enforcement cameras on freeways , and Arizona shut down their freeway cameras in July 2010. Camera enforcement programs in California and Florida \"were dismantled after they were found to be operating outside of state law,\" and thirteen other states have laws specifically banning the use of freeway cameras. And all of the highway speed camera systems that have been tried so far in various states have been ordinary radar-camera combinations, not \"point-to-point\" systems that time drivers' progress between checkpoints and calculate an average speed. Although it's not completely beyond the pale of possibility that Florida or some other state might roll out a freeway speed camera system someday, legal and technical hurdles currently preclude the proposition cited in the first example quoted above that Florida will be replacing all its interstate call boxes with tracking cameras by June of 2010. In response to our inquiry to the Florida Department of Transportation (DOT), a representative with the Intelligent Transportation Systems Section of the DOT's Traffic Engineering and Operations Office told us that: The rumor is not true; the Department will not be replacing the call boxes with cameras to catch speeders. This rumor is not true for several reasons: 1) It is illegal. The Department does not have legislative authority to attach speed enforcement cameras on our call box poles 2) It is technically impossible. The call boxes do not have a dedicated power source which will be needed to operate the cameras. It would be cost prohibitive to run power to all the call boxes, making use of the poles impractical. The call boxes run off of a spring that powers a small generator which generates enough power to send a signal for assistance. The spring is tightened by pulling down a handle on the front of the box when the handle is released, the spring is released, running the generator. Once the signal is sent, the box reverts back to its powerless state. The Connecticut variant of this rumor cited above began circulating in January 2010, falsely attributed to a Danbury [Connecticut] News-Times article by Robert Miller. Likewise, that state's DOT has no legislative authority to issue tickets in such a manner, and the cameras along I-84 are not new and do not time motorists for the purpose of issuing tickets they are ordinary traffic cameras initially installed in the mid-1990s: The [Connecticut] state DOT does have cameras along I-84 and along other highways in the state. It also has radar set up along the road. It's had them both in place for years. [DOT spokesman] Kevin Nursick said the state uses the devices to monitor traffic flow. It can use the cameras to see if there's been an accident. It can use the radar to learn if traffic has suddenly slowed. But neither the DOT nor the Connecticut State Police have ever used this system for law enforcement for catching speeders and issuing tickets. In fact, it's specifically forbidden by state law to do so. \"We cannot use this equipment for law enforcement,\" Nursick said. \"You can't do it without a change in state statutes.'' Another iteration of this item originally circulated back in 2006 maintained that such point-to-point speed devices were in operation along Australia's M5 and M7 motorways: IMPORTANT INFORMATION: The M5 and the M7 are now equipped with Point to Point speed devices. Once you enter the M7 for instance, you pass the e-tag and it beeps. At the same time a camera takes a photo of your car and records the exact time. For those who have exited the M7, they would be aware that upon exit the e-tag system beeps again as you leave. At the same time another camera at that point takes a photo of the car and the time. Then the computer calculates the time it has taken you to travel between the two points and calculates your speed. If you have completed the clocked journey too fast, you are given a speeding ticket. At the present time the speed limit is 100kph and you have a tolerance of 102kph and no more. One fraction over that speed and you are issued with a fine automatically. Also remember that school zone camera;s are not speed tolerant. Anything over, even 41kph, is a fine. This means people will be doing 38kph to avoid any differences in their speedo readings Remember, this is going to be a very costly experience for some drivers. Itis also going to mean vehicles will be travelling at 95kph in order to ensure that no ticket is issued. What a shock some drivers are going to have when they have used this roadway for a week and get a week's worth of tickets BOTH WAYS. Of course your license will also be recalled for three months and you know the rest Take the advice and if you ignore it, remember this email when you pay all those fines. Also, remember that now with the new legislation, fighting a speed camera fines is almost impossible. You must prove the device is faulty and if you are not a technician working on them, you have no chance of beating the fine. Please also take into regard that the Pacific Highway has a set which are recognisable as the large steel frames over the lanes with a speed camera nearby and located some distance up the road is another large metal frame with a speed camera. These new point to point systems are being put onto any and all expressway or highway where vehicles are not able to exit between those points. Westlink M7 quickly debunked this version of the rumor as false as well: Westlink M7 has dismissed a hoax email currently circulating that claims that the motorway has implemented a secret speed fine based on the time a vehicle enters and exits the motorway. Flan Cleary, General Manager of Westlink M7, said that the email was a hoax and that no secret speed enforcement system operates on the Westlink M7. Westlink supports safe driving and urges all motorists to comply with posted speed limits. \"However, the secret speed fine system detailed in the hoax email does not exist,\" Mr Cleary said. \"Speed limits are enforced on the Westlink M7 through the normal policing measures that operate on all NSW roads.\" Mr Cleary said that Westlink will be installing signs that remind motorists that speed cameras are used in NSW. These are the standard speed camera signs seen on roads across the state and do not mean that any new or secret speed system operates on the Westlink M7. It is true, however, that average-speed cameras employing automatic number plate recognition technology have been put into place (at least on a trial basis) in a few locations around the world, primarily in Europe and the UK .", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-410539/Drivers-avoid-speeding-tickets--changing-lanes.html;https://web.archive.org/web/20060624005026/http://westlinkm7.com.au/news-Detail.asp?NewsID=80;http://www.ct.gov/dot/cwp/view.asp?a=2354&Q=290242;http://www.thenewspaper.com/news/27/2764.asp;http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/wayoflife/06/04/aa.speed.cameras.highways/index.html;", "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, July 2009] Starting June 1 2010 All Interstate in Florida, will have the Call boxes (on side of the interstate) replaced with Cameras that will take a picture of your tag at one box, and then another picture as you pass the next.

HOV (aka carpool or diamond) lanes are restricted to those vehicles that have a stated minimum number of occupants or (in some parts of the U.S.) bear the appropriate stickers granting them that right (i.e. certain hybrid automobiles).", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Because they are generally less populated than the rest of the highway, HOV lanes pose a temptation to unaccompanied drivers snarled in the daily commute and wistfully looking over at the more free-flowing diamond lanes. Heavy fines serve to keep most of the covetous to the straight, narrow, and more crowded, but not all. Some singletons choose to brazen it out and take the risk of being ticketed. Others attempt various deceptions designed to make it appear they have passengers in their vehicles. And then there are the pregnant women who will, when pulled over for HOV lane violations, claim their unborn children as additional people in their vehicles. Early in 2006, an Arizona woman tried just that. Candace Dickinson had been fined $367 for improper use of a High Occupancy Vehicle (aka carpool) lane. She was caught driving in the HOV lane on Interstate 10 on 8 November 2005 even though alone in her vehicle. Sgt. Dave Norton of the Phoenix police made the stop. When he asked Dickinson how many people were in the car, \"she said two as she pointed to her obvious pregnancy,\" he said. Sgt. Norton said this was the second time in the last four years that a woman tried to use the defense against him, but the first one was a \"whole lot less pregnant\" than this driver. (Dickinson's son Cole was born on 23 November 2005.) Dickinson chose to fight the ticket by asserting in court that Arizona traffic laws don't define what a person is, so the child inside her womb justified her use of the lane. Phoenix Municipal Court Judge Dennis Freeman used a \"common sense\" definition of the statutes governing use of HOV lanes in which an individual occupies a \"separate and distinct\" space in a vehicle. \"The law is meant to fill empty space in a vehicle,\" Freeman said. The California Highway Patrol sees it the same way : I'm pregnant. The HOV lane requires two persons in a vehicle. Now that I'm eating for two, can I use this lane? California law requires that in order to utilize the HOV lane, there must be two (or, if posted, three) separate individuals occupying seats in a vehicle. Until your \"passenger\" is capable of riding in his or her own seat, you cannot count them. Other lone drivers have attempted to avail themselves of the convenience of the HOV-lane commute without legal penalty, with similar degrees of success. In February 2010, 61-year-old K.A. Franscinella of Mount Sinai, New York, attempted to fool those who police the carpool lane with a female mannequin sporting a long dark wig, blazer, shirt, and scarf. The officer who pulled her over immediately knew something was odd about the so-called passenger who was wearing sunglasses and using the visor on a cloudy morning. In January 2006, a driver was stopped and ticketed on U.S. 36 in Westminster, Colorado, for driving in a carpool lane with a mannequin he created by applying make-up to a wig stand and affixing it to clothing stuffed with newspapers (then strapping the finished product into the passenger seat with a seatbelt). In November 2005, Kevin Morgan of Petaluma, California, was handed a $351 citation in Marinwood for driving in a carpool lane with a kickboxing dummy propped up in the passenger seat. The dummy was dressed in a baseball cap and Miami Dolphins windbreaker and wore a seatbelt. In March 2002, a motorist with a full-size mannequin as a passenger drove into the car-pool lane on Interstate 405 in Renton, WA, triggering a chain of collisions involving six cars and two buses. Susan Aeschliman-Hill of Kent, WA, had outfitted her immovable companion with a wig, sweater, and makeup. The accident occurred when Aeschliman-Hill darted into the carpool lane between two buses. Among those injured were fifteen students on a class trip. In 2001, a policeman in Atlanta pulled over a carpool lane violator who'd positioned a dummy in the passenger seat. The mannequin in question was wearing a sports jacket, a pair of sunglasses, and a baseball hat. Best of all, he had been positioned so he was holding a newspaper. Ruses motorists have used to conceal their driving alone in car-pool lanes: Store mannequins, blow-up dolls, kickboxing dummies, cardboard cut-outs, and even balloons (with faces drawn on them in marking pen). Buckling the passenger-side seat belt and pretending to talk to someone reclining in that seat. Covering an empty infant seat with a blanket or placing a doll in it. Taping a styrofoam wig stand to the passenger headrest and topping it with a blonde wig. Strapping the family pooch into the passenger seat. And no, lone hearse drivers transporting clients to their final rests cannot use the diamond lane.

Just as we rarely give thought to the possibility of meeting a car traveling the wrong way on a one-way street, so too do we rarely pause to wonder where our traffic laws came from or who invented the crosswalk.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Meet William Phelps Eno (1858-1945), an innovator who long ago earned the sobriquet \"the Father of Traffic Safety.\" Born in New York City, this forward-thinking man observed the massive traffic jams of his era and from those observations formulated solutions that carried over from the days of horses and carriages into the automotive age. In 1900 he penned the treatise \"Reform in Our Street Traffic Urgently Needed,\" which immediately established him as a traffic safety expert, a mantle he was to wholeheartedlyembrace. In 1903 he developed the world's first city traffic code (for New York City) and the first traffic plans for New York City, London, and Paris. It was Eno who invented stop signs and who envisioned one-way streets, taxi stands, traffic circles, and pedestrian safety islands. He wrote the first manual of police traffic regulations, and it was he who designed the circular traffic pattern that courses around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. In 1921 he established the Eno Transportation Foundation, a non-profit study center located in Washington, D.C. The Foundation is dedicated to improving all modes of transportation ground, air, and water. Eno was always a great fan of horseback riding but did not place all that much faith in the automobile, thinking it but a fad. He never learned to drive, and when events in his life necessitated car travel, he relied on a chauffeur. Eno's penchant for peculiarity outlived him. In 1996 his old home in Westport, Connecticut, came under the steady assault of determined bargain hunters who misunderstood the \"bargain\" they so intently pursued. Eno's 32-room mansion and the land it stood on had been sold for $1.5 million, but the buyer wanted the choice waterfront land for the purpose of subdividing it, not for the 119-year-old building that stood upon it. The old manse was to be razed to make way for new housing. Rather than see old building torn down, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation stepped in and offered it for $1 to anyone who would cart it away and give it a good home elsewhere. The costs of barging the mansion to a new site and restoring it were estimated at $500,000 and $1.7 million , respectively. The Today Show helped publicize the scheme, but unfortunately people heard only what they wanted to hear: that they could have a mansion for $1. Everything about the land not coming with it and the building having to be carted away and set up elsewhere went in one ear and out the other. The property was overrun by folks determined to look it over, and they showed up at all hours of day and night, often necessitating calls to the police to have them removed. The previous owner (who was living in its carriage house) was driven to distraction by the never-ending stream of phone calls and letters pleading for the house. \"Keep Out\" signs had to be posted, and the road leading to the mansion had to be chained off to keep dollar-waving people out. Meanwhile, the Trust's office was also fielding hundreds of calls and letters, some coming from those who thought this was a lottery, and one from a gal who thought the mansion was a prize offered for an essay-writing contest. Even utter chaos eventually dies down. Hundreds upon hundreds of inquiries later, no one really wanted the house. It was ultimately demolished in July 1997.

electronic toll collection system (which automatically reads RFID transponders in tags carried within automobiles as those vehicles pass through E-ZPass toll lanes, thereby allowing motorists to avoid having to stop and pay at numerous individual toll booths), pessimists have been predicting that it's only a matter of time until municipal governments start using the passes as a means of catching speeders. By recording how long it takes cars to travel between two E-ZPass toll collection points, the theory goes, the system can automatically calculate whether a particular vehicle must have exceeded the speed limit at some point in its journey between the two checkpoints and, if so, automatically issue a citation to the automobile's registered owner (even though no law enforcement officer or device ever actually observed the vehicle in the act of speeding, and there would be no precise record of when and where the infraction occurred, or by how much the speed limit was exceeded). The e-mail reproduced above asserts that the state of New York is going to take this concept one step further, nabbing even motorists who don't use the E-ZPass system by embedding readable strips or RFID chips within vehicle registration stickers and installing recording devices at roadsides throughout the state.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "We have yet to find any verified accounts of municipalities (in any state) automatically issuing traffic citations based on transit times recorded by electronic toll collection systems. Although many people maintain they have received such citations (or know someone who has), those claims have so far always proved to be misunderstandings: Motorists who travel too fast as they pass by E-Z Pass toll collection points may receive letters warning them to slow down while they use E-Z Pass lanes or else risk cancellation of their E-Z Pass accounts, but those letters are not law enforcement citations, nor are they based on speeds calculated by recording times of passage between two checkpoints. As for the claim that the state of New York is planning to embed detection strips or chips in vehicle registration stickers in order to catch speeders, we have found no evidence that such a plan is being enacted, and state officials have disclaimed it: Reports that the state Thruway Authority will start using its E-Z pass to calculate when people get on and off the toll road and issue speeding tickets are false, officials said. The rumor started circulating through e-mail and has since spread, said Sarah Kampf, public relations officer with the agency. Both the authority and state police said no such plans are in place. Any worried motorists who have heard the false reports should just stick to the speed limit and they won't have any problems, said Guy Holbert of the Thruway Authority office in Syracuse. WHAM-TV in Rochester, New York, noted that current state law would not allow for the issuance of citations based upon E-ZPass information: It is true the technology exists to encode documents, such as a driver license, with specific hidden information. However, in a statement, the New York Thruway Authority said, \"The authority and state police do not use E-ZPass to enforce vehicle and traffic law.\" To do so would require a change in the law. Currently, it takes an observation, or radar by a police officer to charge someone with speeding. This rumor may have been fostered by a distortion or misunderstanding of New York governor Eliot Spitzer's proposed plan to comply with the Real ID act by issuing new state driver's licenses in order to take advantage of recent technologies such as RFID and facial biometric scans. Similar systems (although camera-based rather than RFID-based) for tracking average motorist speeds over a distance have been tried on some particularly accident-heavy stretches of road in other parts of the world.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4681507.stm;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2215188,00.asp;http://www.ezpass.com/;", "Example": "New York State started a pilot program upstate north of Albany on the Northway to catch speeders using the Easy Pass system. Recording devices were installed at intervals along the highway. Once an Easy Pass equipped vehicle passes, the device registers the account number and the time. Same is again registered at the next \"check-point\". Based upon the distance between the register points and the posted speed limit, the state is sending speeding tickets in the mail to the guilty persons. Because every driver does not have Easy Pass, the State is \"perplexed\" as what to do to impose the system state-wide. The solution has been found. Soon all new vehicle registration stickers will have a metal strip or chip imbedded in same. This will take the place of the Easy Pass system as stated above. When a vehicle passes the registering device, the strip will relay all the information. This is not fictional. New York State contracted with VERIZON to install the system. The system has already been installed and the entire Bronx River Parkway in Westchester County has been \"wired\" for when the new system begins. Once the State makes the new program public and advises all motorists of the potential for numerous speeding tickets, it will also reveal that the system has already been installed. Another reason that will be given for the new system is to enable the authorities to track stolen vehicles, to trace kidnap victims, to monitor and trace suspected criminals and terrorists, etc. BIG BROTHER IS ALIVE AND WELL.

the mail truck has the right of way. However, traffic laws are generally a state matter, and we haven't found any state whose vehicle code specifies that mail trucks have the right of way over all other vehicles, including emergency vehicles. Nor have we found any federal statute that supersedes state traffic laws to establish right-of-way primacy for mail trucks.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "So how did this belief come to be? Over the years several respondents have made stabs at providing plausible answers to this conundrum: The answer to that old theoretical puzzler is the mail truck, by virtue of its federal government status.1 That explanation makes a little sense in that we naturally expect federal authority may supersede state or local authority (even if the Postal Service's status as a \"federal agency\" isn't quite what it used to be), but a mail truck? Cars driven by FBI agents, Border Patrol automobiles, and Army vehicles (including tanks) also have \"federal government status,\" but we're not aware of any laws giving them the right of way over all other vehicles, even in non-emergency situations. [A] postal truck should have priority because maybe it was carrying a declaration of war that just had to be delivered while the emergency vehicles waited.2 Ho ho ho. Imagine Franklin D. Roosevelt announcing to Congress, \"I'm sure I dropped that declaration of war against Japan in the mail the day before yesterday. We'll just have to hold off beginning hostilities for a day or two until we can send out another copy. Tell the Navy they'll just have to sit tight for now.\" (Declarations of war were typically hand-delivered to government officials by members of the declaring countries' diplomatic corps, not shipped out via regular mail.) He gave as an example the fact that if a fire truck, an ambulance carrying a patient and a police car in pursuit of a criminal meet a mail truck carrying mail at an intersection, the mail truck has the right of way. \"In the days when this was established,\" explained Mr. Sulzer, \"communication was vital.\"3 Communication has always been vital, but so has putting out fires, catching criminals, and saving lives. Though it may be, as Mr. Sulzer suggested, that the mistaken belief about mail trucks was in part a carryover from the railroad era: \"As you may know,\" he wrote, \"the 'fast mail' trains were an important part of the operation of the railroads in their heyday. \"The mail contracts were an important source of income for the railroad and, indeed, one of the purposes for the government establishing railroads was communication through the mail. \"Generally speaking, the fast mail trains had right of way over all other traffic. That is, the track was cleared ahead of the mail. All other traffic went off on a switch track to let it by.\" We posed this question to the Los Angeles Times ' \"Street Smart\" column back in 1994, and (once they were convinced it was a legitimate question) they responded: [T]he mail truck does not have the right of way. Like other vehicles and even pedestrians, it must pull to the side of the road to let the emergency vehicles pass. Our answer comes from Bill Madison, a spokesman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Everyone else we queried thought the question was unique, to say the least. \"That's about the craziest thing I've ever heard,\" said an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Division. \"I don't even know how people have time to think about stuff like that.\" Undaunted, we pressed on. \"OK,\" a California Highway Patrol officer said in a tone that suggested he didn't take the question seriously. Finally, Madison responded. \"The mail truck is not even in the running, unless the guy is a complete idiot,\" he said.4 A similar query we posed to the United States Postal Service produced the reply that the USPS was also unaware of any laws granting mail trucks right of way status. Okay, so if the mail truck doesn't have the right of way, then who does? \"Street Smart\" also provided an answer to this question from a California DMV spokesman: [O]nce the mail truck is safely to the side of the road, the question becomes trickier. Madison speculated that dispatchers would solve the situation before it arose. If they did not, he said it would make sense for the police car to go first and then the firetruck. The ambulance would go last, he said, because if \"five seconds makes a difference, you probably aren't going to save the guy anyway.\"4 We have to wonder about that answer, though: If five seconds makes a difference, then the fire department probably isn't going to save the burning building, nor the police catch the fleeing criminal either. We do note that the belief in a mail truck's having the right of way over emergency vehicles is a very old one, as evidenced by this 1920 report of a New York mail truck driver who (unsuccessfully) asserted that he was not at fault for colliding with a fire engine because he had the right of way: Mail Driver Is Fined Filipo Gateo, 36 years old, of 230 Mulberry Street, driver of an automobile mail truck that was in collision with a hose truck of Engine Company No. 55 at Watts and Varick Streets, on August 27, was fined $35 by Magistrate Francis X. Mancuso in Traffic Court yesterday. Gateo, who was charged with reckless driving, contended that the mail truck had the right of way, but the Magistrate held that fire apparatus had the right of way over all other vehicles.5 This issue seemed to be common fodder for newspaper \"Notes & Queries\" columns in the early 20th century, with the proffered answer inevitably being that the mail truck did not have the right of way, as demonstrated by this 1912 example: Q: Would you kindly publish in your paper which has the right of way among the following: Fire engine, ambulance, United States mail wagon, and oblige a steady reader? A: In the police regulations all three are given the right of way in street traffic. According to the Bureau of Information at Police Headquarters, there is no order of precedence specified, but practically the fire engine always takes the right of way over ambulance and mail wagon, and the ambulance over the last named. The mail wagon's urgency is not supposed to be a matter of seconds.6 In fact, as the following 1893 newspaper item shows, this same question was being debated (and the same answers provided) well over a century ago years before the automobile came into common usage: Q: In case a fire engine, a United States mail wagon, and a hospital ambulance should come together, what one would have the right of way, and what one would come second? A: The impression of the local postal authorities is that the order would be: ambulance, fire engine, mail wagon. The ambulance is on a mission of life and death, the fire engine is concerned with saving property, and the mail wagon is occupied with only routine work. The first two are intended for extraordinary calls, and are drilled to a pace which mail wagons are not obliged to take.7 Finally, as the following 1887 example suggests, the issue may originally have arisen because states typically had laws mandating the right of way for emergency vehicles and laws prohibiting interference with mail delivery vehicles, but no regulations to cover the possibility that the two might come into conflict: In regard to \"Beverly's\" pertinent inquiry as to which has the right of way, \"the United States mail or a steam fire engine,\" I would say that although the law may not decide the matter ... in point of fact neither vehicle need to be detained by the other, where the drivers use ordinary judgment, and when teamsters are governed by simple courtesy.8 Ultimately, the best response to this burning question may have been the one provided in the concluding sentence of the 1893 query and answer cited above: \"This whole matter, however, is theoretical rather than practical.\"", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "", "Example": "Here's a question for you. Although hypothetical, it could happen. If a firetruck, police car, postal truck and ambulance all with sirens blaring and lights flashing (except the mail truck, of course) arrived simultaneously at four corners of an intersection, who would have the right of way? Who should be allowed to cross the intersection first?", "Last Updated": "1 April 2011", "Credibility": "false", "URL": "www.snopes.com/autos/law/fourway.asp", "Claim": "A United States Postal Service

correct road, get on it heading the right direction, and exit at the proper off-ramp is challenge enough. There actually is a rhyme and a reason to the numbering system used for U.S. highways, although the rhymes and reasons vary for different types of roads. Highways generally fall into one of three classes which generally use similar (but not identical) rules in assigning numbers: Interstate highways established under the aegis of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. U.S. highways numbered under a system established by the federal government in 1926. Regional roads numbered under individual state and county systems. INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS: Under the plan developed for a national interstate highway system during the Eisenhower administration, interstate highways (marked with the familiar red-and-blue shields) are numbered according to the following rules:", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "And, just to make things even more confusing, there are quirky exceptions to these rules: I-238 is not a spur off Interstate 38, because Interstate 38 doesn't exist. (The curious can read Grant Cooper's lengthy explanation of how this came to be.) Interstate 99 was assigned a high two-digit number (through legislation), even though it is not a major highway (it runs for only 58 miles between Wolfsburg and Bald Eagle in Pennsylvania) and is farther west than other interstates with lower numbers. U.S. HIGHWAYS: U.S. Highways (or Routes), marked with black-and-white badge-shaped signs, are assigned one- to three-digit numbers. Like interstate highways, they designate north-south roads with odd numbers and east-west roads with even numbers, but the numbering scheme is inverted: the numbers of north-south routes grow larger from east to west, and the numbers of east-west routes grow larger from north to south. NORTH-SOUTH EXAMPLES: US Highway 1 runs from Fort Kent, Maine, to Key West, Florida. US Highway 99 used to run from the Canadian border at Blaine, Washington, almost to the Mexican border at the city of Calexico, California. (Highway 99 has since been supplanted by Interstate 5 and is no longer designated as a U.S. Highway.) EAST-WEST EXAMPLES: US Highway 14 runs from Chicago, Illinois to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. US Highway 82 runs from Alamogordo, New Mexico, to Brunswick, Georgia. STATE AND COUNTY ROUTES: Individual states and counties use different types of signage to designate regional state and county roads. For the most part, states follow the Interstate and U.S. Highway patterns of assigning odd numbers to north-south routes and even numbers to east-west routes, but as always there are exceptions. California's Antelope Valley Freeway runs almost due north from the Los Angeles basin through the high desert, yet it's the 14 Freeway. In answer to that perennial trivia question, the state of Hawaii has three roads designated as interstate highways (all of them on the island of Oahu) because roads established under the purview of the Federal Aid Highway Act and receiving funding from the federal government are considered interstate highways, even if they fall completely within the borders of a single state.

In short: International Driving Permits do exist. The people advertising them are not authorized to sell them directly. (They're either peddling unauthorized, look-alike documents or charging customers hefty mark-ups to help them order IDPs from authorized sellers.) An IDP will not help you to avoid paying for traffic tickets, keep points off your driving record, establish a new identity, or get you into bars if you're underage. An IDP does not provide illegal aliens with documented status, nor does it allow foreigners (legal or otherwise) who do not have current, valid driver's licenses from their home countries to drive on U.S. roads. An International Driving Permit is essentially a booklet containing translations of the information found on your \"real\" driver's license into eleven different languages (including English, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, German, Arabic, Italian, and Portuguese). In accordance with several United Nations conventions on road safety, most U.N. member nations have agreed to recognize and accept IDPs. (Some countries require foreign drivers to have IDPs, some prefer but don't require them, and some don't require them at all.) The IDP is not a license in itself, however it is merely a translation of the current driver's license issued to you by your home country (or state), and it must be used in conjunction with that driver's license. (That is, if you are stopped by law enforcement while driving in another country, they will expect to see both your IDP and your original license.) You cannot obtain an IDP if you do not already hold a valid driver's license .", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Moreover, only two organizations are authorized by the State Department to sell IDPs in the United States: the American Automobile Association and the American Automobile Touring Alliance (through the National Automobile Club ). Anyone else who attempts to sell you any type of international driver's license or permit is either peddling worthless imitation documents or is charging you an exorbitant mark-up (typically 100% or more) to simply order the IDP for you from an authorized seller. (An IDP takes but a few minutes to apply for and costs only $15). Let's go back through the claims in the advertisement reproduced above: Need a new driver's license? As explained above, an IDP is not a \"new\" driver's license. You must already hold a valid driver's license to obtain one, and an IDP is used in conjunction with (not in place of) your existing license. Too many points or other trouble? An IDP will not allow you to avoid points against your driver's license. Any points assessed against you for traffic violations would be applied to your current license. Want a license that can never be suspended or revoked? Your IDP is valid only as long as you hold a valid driver's license; if your license is suspended or revoked, your IDP is no longer good. As well, IDPs are valid for one year only. Want ID for nightclubs or hotel check-in? It's unlikely anyone (in the USA, at least) would accept an IDP as a valid form of identification; in any case, there's no real advantage to it since the IDP contains all the same information as your driver's license. You can't obtain an IDP using a different name from the one on your driver's license, for example, nor can a 16-year-old purchase an IDP that proclaims him to be 21 years old. Avoid tickets, fines, and mandatory driver's education. As noted above, this isn't true. Any tickets or fines assessed against you for traffic violations would be applied to your standard driver's license, not your IDP. Protect your privacy, and hide your identity. Nope, still not true. The IDP contains the same name, address, and other identifying information as your standard driver's license. In general, most U.S. states allow foreign motorists from any of the countries who are party to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic (1949) or the Convention on the Regulation of Inter-American Motor Vehicle Traffic (1943) to drive legally using their valid domestic driver's license while visiting the United States as tourists.

Back in 1986, the city of Augusta, Georgia, had held a James Brown Appreciation Day, and on that day, U.S. Representative Douglas Barnard of Georgia delivered a laudatory speech in which he stated that \"James is indeed our No. 1 ambassador.\" So, Adrienne Brown's lawyer, Allen W. Johnson, made a motion before the court offering Rep. Barnard's statement from two years earlier as proof of James Brown's ambassadorial status, maintaining that Brown was \"America's No. 1 ambassador and as such should have diplomatic immunity and such immunity extends to his wife, the accused herein.\" The ploy didn't work. Johnson withdrew the motion the next day, claiming that he had filed it only because he was pressed for time and \"was trying to pursue every possible avenue of defense,\" and that he had \"since determined that the congressman intended his comments as a goodwill gesture and a figure of speech,\" not as a literal recognition of Brown's ambassadorial status. In any case, Johnson's motion was bound to fail: Diplomatic immunity shields officials of foreign nations from criminal charges while they represent their countries in the United States, and United States officials while they represent America in other countries.

Sometimes, though, one's choice of license plate can command an unexpected and undesirable form of attention.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "In 1979 a Los Angeles man named Robert Barbour found this out the hard way when he sent an application to the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) requesting personalized license plates for his car. The DMV form asked applicants to list three choices in case one or two of their desired selections had already been assigned. Barbour, a sailing enthusiast, wrote down \"SAILING\" and \"BOATING\" as his first two choices; when he couldn't think of a third option, he wrote \"NO PLATE,\" meaning that if neither of his two choices was available, he did not want personalized plates. Plates reading \"BOATING\" and \"SAILING\" had indeed already been assigned, so the DMV, following Barbour's instructions literally, sent him license plates reading \"NO PLATE.\" Barbour was not thrilled that the DMV had misunderstood his intent, but he opted to keep the plates because of their uniqueness. Four weeks later he received his first notice for an overdue parking fine, from faraway San Francisco, andwithin days he began receiving dozens of overdue notices from all over the state on a daily basis. Why? Because when law enforcement officers ticketed illegally parked cars that bore no license plates, they had been writing \"NO PLATE\" in the license plate field. Now that Barbour had plates bearing that phrase, the DMV computers were matching every unpaid citation issued to a car with missing plates to him. Barbour received about 2,500 notices over the next several months. He alerted the DMV to the problem, and they responded in a typically bureaucratic way by instructing him to change his license plates. But Barbour had grown too fond of his plates by then to want to change them, so he instead began mailing out a form letter in response to each citation. That method usually worked, although occasionally he had to appear before a judge and demonstrate that the car described on the citation was not his. A couple of years later, the DMV finally caught on and sent a notice to law enforcement agencies requesting that they use the word NONE rather than NO PLATE to indicate a cited vehicle was missing its plates. This change slowed the flow of overdue notices Barbour received to a trickle, about five or six a month, but it also had an unintended side effect: Officers sometimes wrote MISSING instead of NONE to indicate cars with missing license plates, and suddenly a man named Andrew Burg in Marina del Rey started receiving parking tickets from places he hadn't visited either. Burg, of course, was the owner of a car with personalized plates reading \"MISSING.\" Nonetheless, some motorists still choose personalized plates destined to land them in similar trouble. Jim Cara of Elsmere, Delaware, found that out the hard way when he selected the phrase \"NOTAG\" for the license of his Suzuki Hayabusa motorcycle in 2004: Jim Cara wanted a vanity license tag that would make people laugh. But when he chose \"NOTAG\" for the plate on his Suzuki Hayabusa, a sleek blue and silver motorcycle with a speedometer that reaches 220 mph, the joke backfired. The new tag arrived Saturday under an avalanche of Wilmington parking violations. \"All the traffic tickets say, 'Notice of violation. License number: no tag,'\" Cara said. City computers, talking to state Division of Motor Vehicles computers, had finally found an address for ticketed vehicles that lacked license tags: Cara's home in Elsmere. \"I messed up the system so bad,\" Cara said. \"I wonder if they can put me in jail or something?\" He has received more than 200 violation notices. The mail carrier came twice on Saturday. Cara opened a few. They ranged from $55 to $125 for violations such as meter expirations. Cara, 43, who works for the American Motorcycle Association, said he's been a lifelong prankster. This time, though, \"the cleanup is going to be worse than the joke,\" he said. Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Harvey collected a few more similar tales from readers in August 2004: \"A few days ago, you printed a bit about people getting notices of unpaid parking tickets on vehicles with license plates NOTAG and NO PLATE,\" wrote Richard Turner of Beverly Hills. He recalled thinking, \"It would be cute to have VOID as my license plate. It was cute for a few years, until I started getting the unpaid parking ticket notices. Apparently, 'void' tickets got keyed into computers as valid tickets, but with my plate. Although I got all the tickets dismissed, I ditched the plates.\" And Ralph August of Westchester says a friend encountered the same barrage of strangers' parking tickets after he put an UNKNOWN plate on his car. The DMV took UNKNOWN away from him. In October 2009, the Birmingham News reported on Hunstville, Alabama, resident Scottie Roberson, who in homage to his nickname (\"Racer X\") and his favorite number (seven) had obtained personalized plates bearing a string of seven X's: 'XXXXXXX.' Suddenly, within a year's time, Roberson received multiple mailed notices of parking violations, totaling more than $19,000 in fines, from the city of Birmingham even though he had taken his car to that city on only a single occasion in the previous five years. The culprit was his license plate: About a year ago, Roberson began receiving letters stating he had outstanding parking tickets, sometimes as many as 10 in one day in 10 places, he said. Roberson said he has been to Birmingham only once in the past five years and left without a ticket. He said city officials told him the tickets were issued by mistake because of his vanity plate XXXXXXX.

By its lights, the gendarmes are more likely to sit up and take notice of speeding red cars than they are vehicles of other colors, hence the higher incidence of moving violation citations accumulated by owners of red cars.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Explanations abound as to why red cars would attract more speeding citations than is their statistical fair share. It has been postulated that red, being an especially eye-catching color, unduly attracts the attention of the highway patrol, therefore even when every car on the road is whipping past at 20 mph over the speed limit, it's the rubicund chariots that suddenly discover flashing lights in their rearview mirrors. Another theory has it that a color-prompted optical illusion makes red cars appear to be going faster than they actually are and so works to get them clocked more often by John Law. Color-influenced driver behavior has also been suggested, with the rubious shade of such vehicles working to increase their drivers' breathing and heart rates, which in turn incites those behind the wheel to drive faster without their consciously being aware of having made that decision. Another line of reasoning ties assumptions made about sports cars (that people who own them tend to drive fast) to red's being one of the most popular colors for such vehicles if sports cars are ticketed more often, and more sports cars tend to be red, then red cars would earn proportionally more speeding tickets than would vehicles of other colors. They're great theories, one and all. Problem is, their premise is flawed as it does not appear that red cars get cited for speeding more often than they statistically should. Whenever they've been asked about the rumor, police across the U.S. have consistently denied any connection between vehicle color and tickets issued or the allegation that they write up the drivers of red cars more often than they do other motorists. Said Sgt. Thornnie Rouse, a trooper with the Maryland State Police for more than 20 years: \"You don't care about the car's color, you care about the violation. If a red car and a green car drive past you and the green car is going 30 mph over the speed limit, the driver of the green car is the one who is going to get stopped.\" Similarly, Sgt. Thomas Miller of Clearwater, Florida's traffic enforcement unit said, \"It's not the color of the car that matters, it's how fast it's going.\" Likewise, a California Highway Patrol officer we asked about this rumor asserted it's drivers doing something different or unusual that catch the eyes of highway patrolmen, regardless of the color of their vehicles. But of course such statements aren't in and of themselves disproof of anything, because police might well not recognize their own bias when it comes to which vehicles they choose to pursue. Yet what those in law enforcement have had to say on this topic over the years finds support in the one and only study (informal or otherwise) we could locate about correlation of car color to speeding tickets. In an attempt to prove or disprove the belief, in 1990 a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times conducted his own smallish survey of which color of cars were getting the most speeding tickets in his area. He first staked out four intersections in the two counties he was studying and made a tally by color of vehicle of the 1,198 cars that went through them. He then leafed through the most recent 924 speeding citations issued in those two counties to arrive at a count of how many had been issued to each color of car. Last, he compared the two results to see if the resultant percentages closely approximated one another or were badly out of sync. His findings challenged the belief about red cars being dunned with proportionally more of the speeding tickets. Red cars accounted for 14 percent of the local vehicle population and about 16 percent of the citations for speeding, which is not a significant difference. Surprisingly, his informal study did reveal certain statistically significant differences, but they had to do with other colors of vehicle. White cars, which accounted for 25 percent of the local vehicle population, received only 19 percent of the tickets, which meant such jalopies were cited for their transgressions less often than they should have been. This raises a new hypothesis: Rather than red attracting the unwelcome attentions of the highway patrol, perhaps instead it is the case that police tend not to notice white vehicles that are breaking the law. Gray cars were the ones that gained a greater share of the speeding tickets than they statistically should have: while they accounted for only 6 percent of cars on the road, they pulled down 10 percent of the tickets issued. On the flip side, silver cars got only 5 percent of the tickets, yet they represented 10 percent of the car population. In addition to the \"earn more speeding tickets than they should\" theory, other mistaken beliefs attach to red cars: They are widely thought to be stolen more often or be involved in a greater number of accidents: [Collected via e-mail, 2005] I continuously hear the rumor that statistics \"prove\" that red cars are stolen more than any other color, even to the extent that insurance companies are wary with red cars, due to the increased theft factor. Red car owners thus have higher rates. The idea is that the color red attracts car thieves, I guess like hummingbirds. Those in the automobile insurance business deny they're charging more to insure red cars than comparable vehicles of other colors, and this would not be the case if red cars were more likely to be stolen or involved in accidents. Regarding the belief that a vehicle's color drives up its insurance premiums, says Jeanne Salvatore, vice president for consumer affairs for the Insurance Information Institute in New York City: \"It's not the color, it's your driving record.\" She's never heard of any insurance company charging more for red cars. However, rates are often higher for sports cars of any color, as they are more expensive to buy and repair and are stolen more often. The belief that red cars get ticketed more frequently for speeding has led to the development of an urban legend about police officers adapting the billiards game of snooker to their work: [Healey & Glanvill, 1996] A friend of a friend was determined to find a career where he could serve the public, be a useful member of society and make something of himself. But he joined the police force instead. Breezing through the basic training, he quickly found himself 'partnered' with an old hand on traffic control. They had a cracking Range Rover jam sandwich to cruise around in and the new rozzer was thoroughly enjoying the work. There was only one problem - his partner. He naturally respected his senior's experience, but some of his operational decisions were questionable, to say the least. One day they were peacefully poised on a ramp by the motorway hard shoulder when the rookie spotted a flagrant abuse of Her Majesty's speed regulations. He eagerly pointed out the culprit. The older man simply looked up, screwed his eyes, shrugged, and carried on reading his paper. This happened four or five times before the older cop set off in hot pursuit and pulled an offender in a red car. This chain of events recurred throughout their shift: the older man ignoring some offenders and booking others seemingly on a whim. The lad initially kept his own counsel, but when his superior pulled yet another red car, he could take no more. 'Now l-look,' quavered the youngster, slamming down a Biro symbolically. 'Just what do you think you're blimming well playing at?' 'Snooker,' came the sharp reply. 'First you stop a red car, one point. Then a black car - that's seven - and so on until after 15 reds we go on to the colours. Every force in the country plays it.' And then, flicking shut the youngster's gawping mouth, he added: 'I got a maximum 147 break last week.' BBC News offered the following tongue-in-cheek advice to motorists looking to avoid being bagged in the non-existent game of highway snooker: 1) Don't drive red cars - because there are 15 reds on a snooker table, the reds are much more likely to get potted. 2) Similarly, don't drive black cars. Although they may look sleek, stylish, moody and expensive, earning seven points makes them the top target. 3) It's probably not a good idea to drive pink cars either. Not only are they high scorers, but the chances of looking sleek, stylish, moody or expensive are slim. 4) If you don't have a red car, you should still be wary. Driving behind them could make you liable for a swift one-two, with you both being \"potted\" in swift succession. 5) In the rules of the game, yellow, green and brown should be fairly safe bets, as they are low scoring. Getting a bad position after a red might give a playing officer no choice, though. 6) White cars are safest of all. Police cars, being white, act as the cue ball in the game. So if a white car is booked, it is tantamount to a foul and will count as four points away. Luckily for all concerned, the BBC then redeemed itself by proffering this eminently sensible suggestion: \"Simplest of all, and surely the advice straight-faced coppers would give, is don't speed and you won't be caught.\" Barbara \"unsnookered\" Mikkelson Sightings: In an episode of the television comedy The Big Bang Theory (\"The Euclid Alternative,\" original air date 20 October 2008), Sheldon insists that he not be given a red car in the simulator provided to teach him driving skills, stating they get more speeding tickets.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.billiardworld.com/snooker.html;", "Example": "After recently buying a red car I have been advised by many people, each with the voice of authority, that police are known to stop red cars more often than those of any other color.

1981 film Cannonball Run , wherein the Japanese entrant in a no-holds-barred cross-country road race makes use of lights-out driving, a quieted motor, and night vision goggles to evade police. One scene even has him blowing past a radar trap and the cops there deciding not to pursue him.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "My earliest sighting of this tale being told as a true story comes from around that time from a fellow who says he heard it on the playground while in elementary school. Since then it's been told by any number of folks, almost without exception male. Plot snippets from movies can become urban legends, provided their basic premises are appealing enough and something in them resonates with current societal fears or wishes. The 'stealth car' qualifies on every level. In one sense, the story is about evil drug dealers who can afford fantastic cars thanks to their ill-gotten gains and are again putting the public at risk, this time by driving like invisible maniacs in the night. That the police eventually work out what's going on and slap the irons on these baddies confirms our need to believe law enforcement is equal to the task of taking on the drug trade and overcoming it. In this story, the monied conscienceless drug king proves no match for the honest cop who starts out befuddled and overmatched but ends up victorious. In another sense, the tale is the ultimate automotive 'wish fulfillment' legend which leaves folks drooling over the sugarplum of an impossibly fast car invisible to the gendarmes. Speed limits are all well and good, provided they're enforced on everyone else ; each of us secretly longs for the unfettered freedom to do whatever we like on the open road, including setting new land speed records, if that's what takes our fancy. At least in the realm of imagination, safety and concern for others ranks well behind the desire to have the baddest car in town, the jalopy the cops can never touch. Luckily (considering the state of human nature), the stealth car of legend is not also one of reality. Though fast cars exist, they can't be rendered invisible to all our senses and detection devices with a slap of black paint and the extinguishment of their lights. Even if the dream machine were made harder to see and its engine muffled, the noise it made as it passed would still be audible. More telling, the night vision goggles the driver donned would put him at risk of crashing and burning in very short order, especially if he were cruising the nation's highways at incredible speeds. Night vision goggles may seem to turn night into day (a day rendered in green, anyway), but they do so at the expense of depth perception. Though perfectly serviceable if the wearer is standing still or traveling at a controlled speed, NVGs produce a limited depth of field quite dangerous to someone trying to make sense of a rapidly changing landscape, where so much as one missed detail can prove fatal. Navigation is further complicated by rain, snow, and fog, all of which cut down the NVG's effectiveness. Light emitted from a car's instrument panel would also adversely impact the clarity of images picked up by the goggles. When used on public highways at any speed, NVGs represent accidents just waiting to happen. Oncoming headlights would cause the operator to be unable to see other objects in the field of view, and just one car coming from the opposite direction could render the NVG-wearer temporarily blind. While one might keep a car on the road during such an interlude at 30 m.p.h., at 200 m.p.h. the need for any sudden maneuver could send the car off the road and into a tree in the blink of an (unseeing) eye. (And if other cars on the road can't see you, you're in danger of their suddenly cutting you off or running into you from behind). The legend's basic premise that any random person can don a pair of night vision goggles, fire up the stealth car, and go rocketing around the country after dark fails the credibility test once the limitations of night vision technology are considered. A driver fresh out of the military and trained in this type of driving might be able to maintain control of a car traveling at 35 m.p.h. on a clear night, but even he is likely to be sent off the road into the ditch by the lights of oncoming traffic. As for someone untrained in the use of NVGs, he's not likely to make it out of the driveway without taking a hedge or two with him. Barbara \"there goes the hedge fund again\" Mikkelson", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "", "Example": "A friend of my father's was a cop in Nevada, and he was assigned the graveyard shift, posted outside of town on a little used section of road, given a radar gun and ordered to stay put and to pull motorists over for speeding. One night, while the officer waits by the side of the road, the radar gun starts screaming for no apparent reason at all, registering about 140. The officer, who was sleepy anyway, attributes this to a faulty gun, and ignores the incident. A week later the same thing happens again, on the same stretch of road, at about the same time at night. This time, however, the gun registers 145, and the officer pays more attention. Later, after his shift is over, he has the gun checked out for problems, and is told it is operating perfectly. A week later, same road, same time, the gun goes off. By now the police officer is confused, and angry. The next week he has men stationed at a road block a few miles down from the spot where he has been positioned. Like clockwork, the radar gun goes off, and he alerts his friends to get ready for whatever is racing down the highway. At the road block is stopped a black Lamborghini, with an engine iced and baffled for silent running. The driver is a drug mule, hauling a load and staying on the backroads, and less frequently monitored highways. The car itself is running without headlights, while the driver wears night vision goggles. Variations: Though the car is always black, its make varies from telling to telling. Lamborghinis are especially popular in this tale, but Maseratis, Ferraris, Jaguars, and Porsches turn up too. (Indeed, any expensive car that is presumed to be fast can be shoehorned into this legend.) This story has been told as a true and local occurrence in Texas, Pennsylvania, California, Kentucky, Nevada, New Jersey, and Florida. Sometimes additional details are given which specify the route: \"from New Orleans to Chicago,\" \"between Erie and Pittsburgh,\" and \"from his office in Henderson, KY to his home in Nashville.\" Usually the driver is described as a drug runner, but non-criminals (rich men who own fast cars) have also been placed behind the wheel. Typical to such stories, often both the speed the miscreant was going (\"200 m.p.h.,\" \"140 m.p.h.\") and the amount and type of drugs confiscated (\"20 lbs. of cocaine\") are specified. One (possibly Cannonball Run-influenced) version attributes the stealth car's presence on the highway to \"a cross-continental race on public roads, $1000 per entrant, winner take all.\"", "Last

that supposedly enable them to gain advantage by manipulating \"the system\" to their favor whether the prize to be won is something as potentially significant as beating a breathalyzer test or keeping points off their driver's licenses, or as trivial as being able to zip through traffic a little faster than other motorists. That in many cases people are passing along rumors about schemes that don't work (and that they've never had occasion to try for themselves) doesn't seem to slow their proliferation.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "A slightly different dynamic is at work in the claim that flashing your high beams at a traffic signal will cause it to change from red to green more quickly: Many motorists have tried it and discovered that it seemingly performs as advertised, thereby documenting the validity of the claim. What they don't realize, however, is that they've stumbled upon another example of the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy . This strategy works, drivers assume, because stop signals are equipped with sensors that respond to the flashing of strobe lights mounted on emergency vehicles. These traffic pre-emption systems automatically interrupt normal traffic light cycling to allow ambulances, fire trucks, and police cars to pass through intersections more quickly and safely by providing them with a steady stream of green lights while keeping opposing traffic halted with red lights. The adventurous motorist thus tries to trick these sensors by rapidly flashing his car's high beams as he approaches a red-lighted intersection, and voil the light turns from red to green. It works! Of course, in many cases the perceived results are nothing more than coincidence the light was already about to cycle from red to green, and the flashing high beams had no effect. Also, in many places advance sensors are placed in the road well ahead of controlled intersections. When these advance sensors detect the passage of an automobile, they place a \"call\" to the next traffic signal; if others sensors detect no vehicles waiting at the next cross street ahead, the signal changes from red to green to allow the oncoming car to flow through the intersection smoothly. Since advance sensors are generally placed at a point about the same distance away from intersections as the point where drivers start flashing their high beams to influence upcoming signals, it can easily appear to the unknowing that such flashing does indeed cause lights to change. A problem with a cause-and-effect belief in this scenario is that many intersections aren't equipped with strobe-detecting sensors, so motorists end up flashing their lights at traffic signals that don't care. And even when drivers happen upon strobe-enabled signals, the sensors are set to detect lights flashing at a rate so rapid (in the neighborhood of 14 flashes per second) that a human working a manual headlight switch couldn't possibly imitate it. Moreover, some traffic pre-emption systems are now activated not just by an on-off alternation of lights, but by a specific pattern of flashing. Naturally, a market has developed for transmitters that can effectively trigger traffic pre-emption systems, but the sale of such devices to non-authorized buyers has now been outlawed in most jurisdictions.

This suggested dodge for getting around the paying traffic fines has been in circulation on the Internet since 1998. Over the years, it has been re-worked and sent about as helpful heads-up to Americans, Australians, and Canadians, each time with the wording of the \"advice\" re-tooled to make it appear applicable to whichever country was being named in the boondoggle. Multiple versions of the basic mailing now exist, with the one cited as the second example most commonly used as the template from which others are created (via changing the spellings of words and swapping in acronyms specific to the target country).", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "As to why people want to believe in the proposed stratagem, the scheme described makes sense, and in its original form it even provided a source . While it was likely a great many of the early mailings' recipients had no idea what that source was , as we have seen time and again, just the mention of one is impressive enough to provide all the assurance required for most people. Is the procedure described by the message valid, though? Well, examining an earlier description of this message may yield some clues: This is an interesting and, I am sure for all you petrol heads an invaluable tip (which I know works). If you find that you have got a speeding ticket or you have gone through a red light or what ever you do to lose demerit points from your license, I have heard of a method to ensure that you DON'T lose any points. It is this: When you get your fine, send a check to pay it, and if the fine is, say $79, then make the cheque out for $82 or some small amount above the fine. The system will then have to send you a cheque back for the difference so eventually you get a cheque for $3. Now, here is the trick DON'T cash the check throw it away. Demerit points are not removed from your license until all of the financial transactions are complete. If you don't cash the cheque then the transactions are not complete, however, the system has got its money so it is happy and doesn't bother you anymore. Source: Rick Thoonen Production Administrator RACV Touring Publications The funny spelling (to Americans, at least) of \"cheque\" and the quaint reference to \"petrol\" in this version should tell us something. And the better separation in the \"Source:\" section gives us the full name, job title, and an acronym for the place of employment of our source. Sounds pretty good so far. But just what, we wonder, does the acronym RACV mean? The \"funny\" spelling noted above was a hint: it's the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria, a state in Australia. This message from the Land Down Under was unwittingly or otherwise \"repackaged\" for American consumption (by someone obviously unaware of the meaning of the source cited), so right away you can cast off any notion that this scheme is going to work in one of the United States of America, much less all of them. Does this scheme at least work in Victoria, then? Even if this worked at one time, it probably didn't work for long given all the publicity the message quoted above generated. In fact, our Australian sources inform us that not only does this point-avoidance method not work now, it never worked in the first place. You can overpay your traffic ticket if you like, but the only result will be that you'll contribute some extra money to the general revenue fund. Later versions of the message claimed: This information came to our attention from a very reliable computer company that sets up the standard database used by each states' DMV. You have to wonder about a \"very reliable computer company\" that puts a glaring loophole in its customers' systems, then tells the world about it. The fact is, every state does not use a \"standard database\" set up by a single company. (Even if any state's system did have such a loophole, they've now had three years' worth of people circulating this message on the Internet to warn them about it.) Some people assert they've tried this scheme and it worked, and though it's certainly possible some people who overpaid their traffic tickets never saw any points go on their records, most likely that was a result of coincidence, not cause-and-effect. As most anyone who's dealt with the DMV knows, things do slip through the cracks now and then, just rarely in your favor. If you feel that spending three extra dollars in the hopes of keeping a ticket off your record is a worthwhile gamble, go ahead and try it.

Such accidents of forgetfulness happen with surprising regularity, and it doesn't take all that diligent a search through old newspapers to dig up news reports documenting one such incident after another: In May 1992, three-month-old Matthew Murray of Worcester, MA, was left strapped in his baby seat on top of his dad's Hyundai. The vehicle got up to speeds of 50 mph on Interstate 290 before the seat slid off the roof, landing the baby (miraculously uninjured) on the busy highway. In December 1997, two-month-old Marcus Abram of the Chicago area was placed in his car seat on the roof of his mom's car while she moved things around inside to make room for two more passengers she was picking up. The child, still strapped to the car seat, fell off the roof of the car into a busy intersection with cars whizzing by in all directions. A passing trucker noticed the baby seat, stopped, and rescued the injured infant. The child fortunately suffered nothing more serious than lacerations to the face and head. In July 1980, six-week-old Brian Kornbach was left in his infant seat on top of the family car while the adults switched places in the front seat. The child was found by a roadside in Queens by a passerby who took the injured infant to the hospital. His parents did not notice they'd failed to bring their son in off the roof until they were somewhere in the Bronx. The above are just a few of the many instances of babies being left on car tops. It's not meant to be a comprehensive list, just a representative one to provide a better idea of how often this happens. Folklorist Jan Brunvand collected information on fourteen such incidents that had taken place between 1975 and 1993.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Some of the real-life babies who went flying off car roofs and into roadside ditches were injured by the experience. In lore, that never happens either the tot is rescued from the roof of the speeding car by a vigilant policeman, or is afterwards found by the side of the road, shaken yet unharmed.

Then they both switched sides and got back into the car. She just assumed that the husband had put the baby back in, but he hadn't even seen it. They drove off, and the baby slid off, but he was OK because he was in a plastic infant seat. About two hours later they realized that they forgot the baby. So they drove back, and someone had stopped for the baby, and the baby was OK. Variations: The situation which prompts the child to be left on the roof varies: It's a long drive and time to change drivers. The baby is placed on the roof while groceries are loaded into the car.

additives said to improve gas mileage. One of these is acetone, a widely-available solvent better known to most of us as nail polish remover. According to some, adding a few ounces of this chemical compound to a tank of gasoline will dramatically increase mileage, supposedly by assisting in the vaporization of fuel.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Although various claims have been made about acetone improving gas mileage by 25% or 30%, those avowals never seem to hold up to independent scrutiny: properly controlled experiments designed to measure the ballyhooed improvement fail to recognize any significant change. Curious motorists working in less controlled settings do at times seem to note an acetone-assisted improvement, yet their results are likely better chalked up to careless measurement or miscalculation, as their findings can't be reproduced in the lab. Confusing matters further is the issue that determining the effect of anything upon gasoline mileage is a bit more difficult to work out than it would seem, because so many different factors can affect the results. The same amount of fuel will produce different gas mileages on different days, depending upon variables such as the type of automobile, the weather conditions, whether the car's air conditioning was running, how fast the vehicle was driven, etc. Eliminating the effects of each of these factors from the computation is generally beyond the abilities of the average car owner with a passing interest in knowing how many miles to the gallon his pride and joy is getting. Were the decision of adding or not adding acetone to one's fuel tank merely a question of whether the practice boosted gasoline performance, that would be one thing, but unfortunately there are other issues to consider, such as the harm that the solvent can work on vehicles. Acetone is corrosive, which means it can eat away at rubber components such as gaskets and O-rings a particularly bad result for cars with rubber hoses in their fuel lines. Acetone will also eat the paint off a car. As Tom of Car Talk noted in January 2006: Here's our final reason not to use [acetone]: It dissolves paint. So if you slip and spill a little bit outside your fuel filler door, you'll have a nice, unpainted line running down to the bottom edge of your rear quarter panel.

One bit of whispered wisdom dictates that a car's battery must never be stored on a concrete or cement floor. The reasons given for this prohibition vary depending on whom one hears the admonition from. Acid leaking from the battery will ruin the floor, say some. Or a battery left sitting on such surface will never again properly hold a charge. Or those particular surfaces will cause a battery to lose some of its charge. Oddly, the reality behind this peculiar automotive belief somewhat mirrors the long-standing urban legend about a mysterious and seemingly nonsensical cooking practice handed down through three generations: just as there was once something to Grandma's oddball cooking secret , so too was there a time when storing car batteries on concrete or cement floors was a lousy thing to do. However (and again just like the \"cooking secret\" legend), whereas at one time there was good reason for the practice, those days have long since passed. Car batteries used to be encased in hard rubber, a substance that was porous enough that battery acid could seep through it and create a conductive path through the damp concrete, draining the battery. The cases of today s batteries, however, are made of sturdier stuff that far better contains their contents than those of yesteryear. As well, time has brought technological improvements to the seals around the posts and the vent systems. These days, the problem of car battery electrolyte seepage and migration has been all but eliminated. Says battery manufacturer Yuasa , \"Nowadays, containers are made from a solid plastic that does not allow any current to flow through it, so the batteries do not discharge, even if they sit in a few inches of water.\" Interestingly, some experts (including Car Talk's Click and Clack) believe that storing car batteries on concrete floors might actually be a better idea than keeping them on shelves or other surfaces because the cold of the floor works to slow the self-discharge (leakage) rate.

Combining the key comic elements of trucks, bullets and stupidity, the tale was a sure winner.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Only one problem with the news item: It didn't happen. It was a fun story dressed up to look like a 25 July 1996 Arkansas Democrat-Gazette article, and it fooled a lot of people. It didn't fool the newspaper the fake news item had been attributed to, though. Here's a debunking of the tale by the very paper that supposedly ran the original story: A frog-gigging story that reportedly appeared in this newspaper is winding its way around the globe like a chain letter. Except the story didn't run in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. And from all indications, it's not true. That's not keeping it from circulating the Internet. In fact, the computer network is proving much speedier and far-reaching than most chain letters. Under headings such as \"True-Life Redneck Story\" and \".22 Cal Ammunition Safety Alert!!\" computer users around the United States are passing on the following story (incorrectly listed as appearing in Arkansas Democrat-Gazette July 25): Two local men were seriously injured when their pickup truck left the road and struck a tree near Cotton Patch on state Highway 38 early Monday morning. Woodruff County Deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident shortly after midnight Monday. Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc, and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock, are listed in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred as the two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog-gigging trip. On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pickup truck's headlights malfunctioned. The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had burned out. As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis noticed that the .22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to the steering wheel column. Upon inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate properly and the two men proceeded on eastbound toward the White River Bridge. After traveling approximately 20 miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The vehicle swerved sharply to the right, exiting the pavement and striking a tree. Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident but will require surgery to repair the other wound. Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and released. \"Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston (shot his intimate parts off) or we might have been dead,\" stated Wallis. \"I've been a trooper for 10 years in this part of the world, but this is a first for me. I can't believe that those two would admit how the accident happened,\" said Snyder. Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's wife, asked how many frogs the boys had caught, and did anyone get them from the truck. While Lavinia worries over the fate of the frogs, Arkansans worry where the story might have originated. There is no town of Cotton Patch in Woodruff County - it's Cotton Plant. No Deputy Snyder has ever worked for that county's sheriff's department. And attempts at verifying the existence of Wallis and Poole have been futile. Could it have a been an attempt to make Arkansans look stupid? \"I accuse a Yankee of it,\" says one Internet observer. No one has claimed responsibility. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette ran that piece out of self-defense it kept getting calls and inquiries about the bullet fuse story, and this seemed the best way to try to put a lid on the spurious story. Where did the tale come from? It was likely a fanciful reworking of an earlier version that had appeared on the Internet in March 1996: Dave so-and-so of Anniston, Alabama, was injured recently after he attempted to replace a tubelike fuse in his Chevy pickup with a 22-caliber rifle bullet (used because it was a perfect fit). However, when electricity heated the bullet, it went off and shot him in the knee. I like the dressed-up telling of it better. Most stories can be improved by tossing in a few hundred frogs.

RKE systems are handy for a number of reasons: they enable drivers to unlock car doors without having to fumble around for keys (a great advantage in darkness, during inclement weather, and when one's hands are full), they enable car owners to give someone else access to their vehicles without having to hand over ignition keys, and they provide a means by which motorists can open their cars to retrieve keys that have been locked inside.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "But what if you accidentally lock your remote entry device in your car along with your keys? (A plausible scenario, as many people carry them together on the same keyring.) If you own a car equipped with a system such as OnStar you can contact an operator and have OnStar unlock your vehicle remotely through a signal sent via a cellular network, but otherwise you have to call a locksmith or get a friend or relative to bring an extra set of keys out to you. Enter the idea of the poor man's OnStar. No need to pay for a fancy car-unlocking service: just use a cell phone to call someone who has access to your spare RKE device and tell him to point it at the phone and press the \"UNLOCK\" button. You simultaneously point the cell phone at your car door, and voila you're in! A nifty solution ... at least it would be if it weren't implausible for most standard remote entry systems. Relaying remote entry system signals via telephone might work if the signals were sound-based, but they're not. An RKE system transmits an encrypted data stream to a receiver inside the automobile via an RF (radio frequency) signal, a signal that can't be effectively relayed via cell phone. (In any event, RKE systems and cell phones typically operate on completely different frequencies; the former in the 300 MHz range and the latter in the 800 MHz range.) (More than a few people have inadvertently fooled themselves into believing the cell phone method of unlocking car doors actually works because they tried it and achieved the desired results not realizing their cars were still within range of their keyless remote devices, and the signals that unlocked the doors were transmitted the usual way [i.e., through the air], not via cellular phone connections.) It's possible this method might work with cars that use something different than standard RKE systems, but it doesn't work with the vast majority of models. As an owner of a vehicle equipped with an RKE system, I've found that it has reduced the likelihood of my locking my keys in the car in an unexpected way: Since I quickly became accustomed to always locking and unlocking the car with the RKE device, and I carry the RKE device on the same ring as my keys, I have to be standing outside the vehicle with my keys in my hand in order to lock it.

Should you lock your keys in the car and the spare keys are home, and you don't have \"OnStar,\" here's your answer to the problem!

"Stories about fiery crashes in which a car's occupants are burned alive thanks to the seat belts that held them in place have been recorded in print as far back as 1981, and one of our readers reports hearing this tale in Ohio in the 1960s.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Common to the legend about the burnt-to-death seat belt wearers is the characterization of the victims as numbering among life's innocents. They are invariably presented as sympathetic figures, a detail which works to make their gruesome deaths seem all that more appalling. One will hear that they were young marrieds with two small children, or five bridesmaids on the way to a wedding, for instance. In this legend, it seems it's not enough the carnage has to be on a large scale (four or five people trapped in a burning car is so much more horrific than having just one fellow torched); the victims have to be such that those hearing the story immediately shake their heads in disbelief at the senseless tragedy in this world. In other words, we're talking nuns, Boy Scouts, little kids, newlyweds, bridesmaids, babies, and puppy dogs. Two cremated salesmen from Des Moines won't wrench the heart the way five crisped Sisters of the Little Charity will. The false belief that it's safer not to wear a seat belt in case the vehicle catches fire persists despite the mountain of evidence countering it. Death by incineration or drowning accounts for less than one-tenth of one percent of motor-vehicle-related traumas. Most passengers who are ejected from vehicles die, and the majority of them are thrown through the windshield. The chances of injury from hitting the pavement, a fixed object, or a moving vehicle (including your own) are also much greater if you are not wearing a seat belt. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says: Most crash fatalities result from the force of impact or from being thrown from the vehicle, not from being trapped. All studies show you are much more likely to survive a crash if you are buckled in. Ejected occupants are four times as likely to be killed as those who remain inside. Yes, but what if the unthinkable happens and the car catches fire or plunges into a river? Being restrained actually increases the chances of escape from burning or submerged vehicles. Those not harnessed in get knocked around during the accident, often resulting in unconsciousness. And an unconscious accident victim has no chance of getting out of a burning or rapidly sinking car. Ann Landers in 1994 and Dear Abby in 1991 both quoted a policeman who'd seen his share of accidents: \"I've never unbuckled a dead man.\" So with the evidence so strongly stacked in favor of buckling up, why do so many persist in not wearing a seat belt and indeed in believing the fiction about the five crisped bridesmaids? The decision not to use a safety restraint is a way to deny the risks of driving. Seat belts are a clear and ever-present reminder that there is danger lurking on the roads ahead, and that any one of us could end up a traffic fatality. As muddle-headed as this must sound, by ignoring the seat belt, by assuring oneself one doesn't need it, one pretends death doesn't exist, or that at least it will never claim you. But of course the \"As long as I don't acknowledge the danger out there, I'm guaranteed to live forever\" justification isn't much to pull out of one's hat when challenged about not wearing a seat belt, hence the mental image of five cinderized bridesmaids in our legend: it's one heck of a rabbit to produce at such a moment. A legend such as this one is a confirmatory tale that affirms the rightness of a course of action the teller is already committed to. And it's a deadly course of action indeed. The Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety estimates that seat belts have saved 102,115 lives from 1986 through 1998. Virtually every study ever conducted indicates that lap and shoulder belts cut the risk of serious or fatal injury by 40 to 55%. Consider that in 1997 in North Dakota, 103 people died in a total of 88 fatal accidents on state roads. Of those 103 victims, 77 were riding in cars equipped with seat belts but were not wearing them. Thirty-four of the 88 fatal accidents were one-vehicle rollovers. Rollovers are among the most dangerous types of accidents for unrestrained drivers and passengers, since so many of them are thrown out of their vehicles. For instance, 27 people were thrown out and killed in North Dakota's 1997 accidents.

Although these accounts are probably \"real\" in the sense that they indeed reflect someone's attempt to describe an automotive mishap that actually happened to him, the explanation about a hydroplaning car's suddenly accelerating and \"taking off like a rocket\" due to the use of cruise control is a garbled one probably reflecting the author's misunderstanding of what had occurred.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Nonetheless, the warning inherent to the tale don't engage your vehicle's cruise control on slippery or wet roads is well worth heeding. Snow, ice, slush, or even rain can cause wheel-spin and loss of control, situations to which drivers must react quickly. Although cruise control can generally be cut off by the driver's simply tapping the brake pedal, the extra reaction time required for a motorist relying upon cruise control to recognize the danger of the situation when his wheels begins to spin or slide on a slippery surface, bring his foot up off the floor to the brake pedal, and disengage the cruise control can be crucial (especially for drivers lured into a hazardous level of inattentiveness on long, flat stretches of road). According to the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia's web page of tips about driving on wet roads: The only way to stop wheels from spinning and maintain control is to immediately reduce power. An activated cruise control system applies continuous power, keeping the wheels spinning. By the time you disengage the cruise control it may be too late you may have already lost control. An example from the weekly \"Drive It Forever'' automotive column by New York Times Syndicate writer Bob Sikorsky provides a description of one such occurrence: Dear Bob: Cruise control can be dangerous. I have experienced, when driving in heavy rain or slush conditions with the cruise control set at a speed of around 70 mph, that one front wheel will hydroplane while the other wheel suddenly gets traction. Result: The car spins out and into the ditch or into traffic. I have been lucky to be able to catch it happening and touch the brake and recover quickly. As a former pilot, I literally wear the car and feel its moves and respond accordingly. Use of the cruise control in these conditions can be dangerous. Enjoy your column every week keep up the good work. Sincerely, B.D., Albany, N.Y. A: While I haven't heard of this particular problem with cruise control, I can see your point and indeed the experience you describe sounds like a hazardous one. The safety implications for an average driver are considerable. I agree, in short: In heavy rain or slush, the cruise should not be set at a high speed. For that matter, though, even without the cruise engaged, high speed under the aforesaid conditions is dangerous in and of itself. You really shouldn't be driving at 70 mph in slippery conditions, cruise or no cruise. Nor should any driver. Wet-road driving is fraught with dangers that are not always immediately apparent. Just a thin layer of water lying on pavement can send an unsuspecting car hydroplaning into another lane the car's wheels skim along the water's surface instead of making contact with the road. Also, roads constantly accumulate oily substances loosed by car exhaust, and this residue settles deep into the pavement. Rain brings this oil back to the surface, making roads especially slippery during that first hour of downpour or misting. Likewise, winter driving carries with it a similar set of perils. Ice, snow, and sleet can make for dangerously slippery conditions, but so too can innocuous-looking slush and all-but-invisible \"black ice.\" Those who habitually rely upon their vehicles' cruise controls should eschew the practice during the winter months, because the moments it takes to disengage cruise may be moments you don't have during a spin-out. Barbara \"spin city\" Mikkelson", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.icbc.com/news/nov20-08;", "Example": "[Collected on the Internet, 2002] I had a wreck a couple of weeks ago and totaled our Lincoln Town Car. I hydroplaned on Hwy 135 between Gladewater & Kilgore, Texas. I was not hurt, just emotionally rattled! I know the Lord was with me. I learned a lesson I'd like to pass on to you. You may know this already but the highway patrolman told me that you should NEVER drive in the rain with your cruise control on. He said if you did and hydroplaned (which I did) that when your tires were off the road your car would accelerate to a high rate of speed (which it did). You don't have much, if any control when you hydroplane, but you are totally in the hands of God when the car accelerates. I took off like I was in an airplane. I'm so thankful I made it through that ordeal. Please pass the word around about not using cruise control when the pavement is wet or icy. The highway patrolman said this should be on the sun-visor with the warning about air-bags. The only person I've found out who knew this (besides the patrolman) was a man who had a similar accident and totaled his car. This has made me wonder if this is not why so many of our young people are dying in accidents. Be careful out there! [Collected on the Internet, 2003] Some good advice, and you may know this already, but it is good to repeat! A 36 year old female had an accident several weeks ago and totaled her car. A resident of Kilgore, Texas, she was traveling between Gladewater & Kilgore. It was raining, though not excessive, when her car suddenly began to hydroplane and literally flew through the air. She was not seriously injured but very stunned at the sudden occurrence! When she explained to the highway patrolman what had happened he told her something that every driver should know NEVER DRIVE IN THE RAIN WITH YOUR CRUISE CONTROL ON. She had thought she was being cautious by setting the cruise control and maintaining a safe consistent speed in the rain. But the highway patrolman told her that if the cruise control is on and your car begins to hydroplaned - when your tires loose contact with the pavement your car will accelerate to a higher rate of speed and youtake off like an airplane.. She told the patrolman that was exactly what had occurred. We all know you have little or no control over a car when it begins to hydroplane. You are at the mercy of the Good Lord. The highway patrol estimated her car was actually traveling through the air at 10 to 15 miles per hour faster than the speed set on the cruise control. The patrolman said this warning should be listed, on the drivers seat sun-visor - NEVER USE THE CRUISE CONTROL WHEN THE PAVEMENT IS WET OR ICY along with the airbag warning. We tell our teenagers to set the cruise control and drive a safe speed but we don't tell them to use the cruise control only when the pavement is dry. The only person the accident victim found, who knew this (besides the patrolman), was a man who had had a similar accident, totaled his car and sustained severe injuries. If you send this to 15 people and only one of them doesn't know about this, then it was all worth it.

Song lyrics were analyzed, photographs were examined, and soon the conspiracy theory was propagated by web sites such as God Like Productions:", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Too bad I can't post the link here because it certainly will get me banned LOL, but it's a VERY VERY well built website, probably made by a die-hard fan of Avril Lavigne, and the author of the article scrutinized several details of her career to came to a conclusion that the Canadian singer hanged herself before the second album and was replaced by a doppelganger, who left several clues about the death of the original Avril, in the lyrics and covers of the next albums. Some lyrics are pretty blatant by the way! I quoted the verses that highlight a possible suicide! According to the article's author, she killed herself after she went home and found out that her parents abandoned her. Nobody's Home: Open your eyes and look outside, find the reasons why. You've been rejected, and now you can't find what you left behind. Be strong, be strong now. Too many, too many problems. Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs. She wants to go home, but nobody's home. It's where she lies, broken inside. With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes. Broken inside. Her feelings she hides. Her dreams she can't find. She's losing her mind. She's fallen behind. She can't find her place. She's losing her faith. She's fallen from grace. She's all over the place. Yeah,oh The elaborate theory was even broken down by popular publications such as Vice and Gawker, and soon fans of the singer started questioning whether or not she was alive. But in July 2015 the \"Avril Esta Morta\" blog admitted that the theory was a completely fabricated one: Avril is not dead... The blog was a way to show how conspiracy theories can seem real. Many people believe everything they see on the internet, but is it right? There are many conspiracy theories about many things, but some seem no more convincing than theories that are not real. Avril Lavigne never died and was replaced by a lookalike, I created this theory to see if people would believe it, and thousands of people believed it was a fact. An important point is that I created this theory with no intention of lying; all I did is offer arguments that anyone could search for information about and prove. I used information to form a real theory that is in fact unreal. I apologize to people who believed that she was dead and feel disappointed about this revelation, but this was an exercise to teach to become more skeptical cand not believe everything you see! It was never my intention to offend anyone, just to create a theory and test people's reaction to it. You will observe I left some clues that it was all just a theory and not a fact, for example when in the beginning of the blog I referenced the \"supposed death of the singer Avril Lavigne.\" In other words, it is just a guess! If you want to believe that she is dead, that is your choice, but I say that it was all just a theory created by me. Unfortunately, the damage was already done. The above-quoted update was only \"liked\" 500 times within six months of its original publication. The Vice article, on the other hand, has been shared tens of thousands of times. As such, a number of Avril Lavigne's fans still believe that she passed away and was replaced with a doppelg nger: I watched a creepy conspiracy video last night about how Avril Lavigne is actually dead and I'm still freaked out jacey (@jacerain) November 5, 2015 I kinda believe avril lavigne is really dead santa baby (@shaghennessy) November 5, 2015 So apparently Avril Lavigne is dead, and has been replaced by a look a like named Malissa. white cheddar (@Duda1Hayley) November 5, 2015 After reading theories about how Avril Lavigne is dead, I'm convinced this is true princess (@Arianaspoon) November 4, 2015 In summation, there is no truth behind the theory that Avril Lavigne killed herself and was replaced by an actress.

for their ferocious appearance but according to the above-displayed viral image, baby great whites are actually kind of cuddly. In January 2016, the above-displayed photo was posted to various social media sites along with the claim that it showed a baby great white shark. While the animal featured in the photo does resemble a great white, according to marine biologist Alan Holyoak, this is actually a salmon shark. On 28 August 2012, Holyoak and his wife found the stranded salmon shark on a beach in Oregon. The marine biologist wrote about the experience on his blog and posted several additional photos of the animal: At first glance I didn't know exactly what kind of shark this was, but I'd narrowed it down to one of three species: White, Porbeagle (a.k.a. Mackerel), or Salmon shark. These sharks all belong to Family Lamnidae and have geographic ranges that include the Oregon coast. Oh, FYI, this family also includes Mako sharks, but this is clearly not one of those!... ... I decided that it was probably either a Salmon or Porbeagle shark because the coloration and teeth didn't look right for a white shark of this size. Juvenile white sharks are much more common along the southern California coast than they are in Oregon, and young whites tend to have a silvery color along their flanks rather than this clearly distinct dark above and white below color pattern you can see in the photo above... ... Later, after this experience was all over and we were back in our room, I did some checking and this was definitely a juvenile salmon shark, Lamna ditrops. Salmon sharks and great white sharks do have a similar appearance, but the Lamna ditrops doesn't compare in size to the great white. Adult salmon sharks can grow as big as 10 feet long but the average size is about 7 feet. According to National Geographic, great whites are nearly twice that size, with some specimens recorded at more than 20 feet in length.

Change.org, ostensibly by (and on behalf of) Muslims, requesting that the city of Munich, Germany, cancel its upcoming Oktoberfest celebration because the event is \"anti-Islamic\": Dear City council of Munich,", "Fact Check": "Are Muslim refugees demanding that the city of Munich, Germany, ban Oktoberfest?", "Description": "I am writing this letter to bring to your attention something that I and many Muslims believe is unfair and requires attention. I would like to inform you that the Oktoberfest is an Intolerant and Anti-Islamic event. We tried to ignore the event, but there too many Un-Islamic acts done at the Oktoberfest. Such as alcohol consumption, public nudity etc. We understand that the Oktoberfest is a yearly German tradition, but we, Muslims, can not tolerate this Un-Islamic event, because it offends us and all Muslims on the earth. We are requesting the immediate cancellation of the upcoming Oktoberfest event. We also believe that the Oktoberfest might also offend all the Muslim refugees coming from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan. The cancellation of the Oktoberfest event will help refugees not to forget their Islamic history. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, Morad Almuradi While the petition was \"real\" in the sense that someone actually posted it to Change.org, it was not written by \"Muslim refugees\" in Germany as implied by some publications. The author of the petition, Morad Almuradi, listed his location as The Netherlands: The intentions of the author were also unclear, but even if the petition were written in earnest, it would represent one person's opinion and not that of all Muslim refugees. Additionally, the viewpoint expressed by the petition appears to be a minority opinion, as the petition has only managed to muster a few hundred signatures, and the majority of those appear to have come from people who signed in order to add hateful comments: Those comments lead us to believe that this petition may was created by an Internet troll in order to foment outrage. The fact that this petition was posted on 11 September, a day on which items critical of Islam tend to reach fever pitch, supports this hypothesis. It should also be noted that anyone can start a petition on Change.org for any reason. The web site is currently hosting petitions asking Beyonce to make another Destiny's Child album, for President Obama to allow a high school student to have a party after homecoming, and for WaWa to bring back roast beef sandwiches. Just because something appears on Change.org doesn't mean that it was written in earnest, that it represents a majority opinion, or that it should be taken seriously.

The virus does not live long outside the body. You cannot get it from consuming food handled by an HIV-infected person; even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus. Dr. Bob Frascino came to a similar conclusion, although in a much sassier manner, when the question was posed on The Body forum in 2011: So you're worried that folks who test HIV positive \"lose moral control\" and inject blood into bananas? Dude, tell me you're kidding. Please tell me you're kidding. Because if you're not kidding, I'll have to assume you're a looney tunes fluffernutter. Yep, totally bat-sh*t crazy. Your blood-banana paranoia is too bizarre to even qualify for urban legend status. If above-displayed photographs do not show bananas that have been injected with blood (HIV-infected or otherwise), then what caused the discoloration they display? It's likely that these bananas are experiencing some form of fungal rot, such as a type referenced in a 2011 New Yorker article about a disease destroying millions of bananas via a fungus described as producing a visual appearance featuring a \"putrefying mixture of brown, black, and blood-red.\" Last updated: 11 November 2015", "Originally Published": " 11 November 2015", "Referred Links": "http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/01/10/we-have-no-bananas;http://www.thebody.com/Forums/AIDS/SafeSex/Q216765.html;http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/transmission.html;", "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, October 2015] I bought a bundle of bananas from the Walmart in Aberdeen tonight and opened it to give to my 2 yr old daughter.

dryer was spread widely via Facebook:", "Fact Check": "Can a rotten banana be \"resurrected\" through the use of rice and a hair dryer?", "Description": "This video has been online since at least July 2014, when it was posted to YouTube by Brandon Queen, who offered this explanation for the banana-resurrecting phenomenon it seemingly depicts: The rice works as an antioxidant and pulls out any excess moisture from the banana. Then the blow dryer artificially simulates thermogenesis by speeding up the retro-fermentation process by activating the polyphosphates and preservatives which essentially reverse-ages the banana. This only works with conventional store bought bananas that use various herbicides, polyphosphates and pesticides. Although this explanation includes scientific-sounding phrases such as \"retro-fermentation\" and \"thermogenesis,\" there is nothing scientific about it. You can not resurrect a rotten banana with rice and a hair dryer. Of course, you can try. On 12 June 2015, YouTube user Crystal Phillips did just that, capturing on video her attempt to recreate this life hack which resulted in nothing more than her ending up with the same \"yucky\" banana she started with: A few theories about how the original video managed to create the illusion of \"resurrecting\" an old banana have been advanced, such as the use of a frozen banana: According to Chow, the peel of a banana will turn black once it has been placed in a freezer, while the meat of the banana will remain fresh (and the video never shows the actual state of the fruit itself prior to its \"resurrection\" so that viewers can ascertain it really was \"rotten\" to begin with): Bananas, like other tropical fruits, are prone to \"chilling injury\"; that is, damage from cold storage. The most obvious sign of it is when yellow banana skins turn black after refrigeration. If the bananas were fully ripened before you refrigerated them, they'll still be fine to eat, though they ll be mushy and the flesh might also have turned brown. The seeming color change of the banana peels could have been accomplished in a number of ways, from digital editing and lighting manipulation to the addition or removal of a coloring agent from its skin.

issues pertaining to income inequality and capitalism from the perspective of a very wealthy individual: Not long after Hanauer's March 2012 talk was filmed, rumors began circulating claiming that TED had deliberately suppressed the clip due to its potentially offensive (to rich people) nature. On 16 May 2012, National Journal published an article contending that TED's organizers had quashed the groundbreaking talk because its content was simply too controversial to release, an odd assertion considering the 2011 emergence of a well-known (and widely reported upon) protest movement known as Occupy Wall Street):", "Fact Check": "Was Nick Hanauer's 2012 TED Talk about income inequality banned because it was \"too politically controversial\" to release?", "Description": "TED organizers invited a multimillionaire Seattle venture capitalist named Nick Hanauer the first nonfamily investor in Amazon.com to give a speech on March 1 at their TED University conference. Inequality was the topic specifically, Hanauer's contention that the middle class, and not wealthy innovators like himself, are America's true \"job creators.\" \"We've had it backward for the last 30 years,\" he said. \"Rich businesspeople like me don't create jobs. Rather they are a consequence of an ecosystemic feedback loop animated by middle-class consumers, and when they thrive, businesses grow and hire, and owners profit. That's why taxing the rich to pay for investments that benefit all is a great deal for both the middle class and the rich.\" You can't find that speech online. TED officials told Hanauer initially they were eager to distribute it. \"I want to put this talk out into the world!\" one of them wrote him in an e-mail in late April. But early this month they changed course, telling Hanauer that his remarks were too \"political\" and too controversial for posting. In the years since 2012, Hanauer's TED clip has paradoxically been viewed millions of times while remaining the focus of articles describing it as described as \"banned,\" \"too controversial,\" or the speech TED \"doesn't want you to see.\" While it's difficult to determine the accuracy of statements about its online availability in March 2012, the clip clearly became widely available and was frequently viewed on sharing sites such as YouTube shortly thereafter, and it has remained popular ever since. But in 2015, many social media users continued to assert Hanauer's talk was banned: Banned TED Talk: Nick Hanauer Rich People Don t Create Jobs (VIDEO) #news http://t.co/wmlAmaIZ48 Hannah Kennison (@HannahKennison1) July 6, 2015 Nick Hanauer on His Banned TED Talk & Why the Middle Class are the Job Creators http://t.co/KKQOqIK5PQ Jonathan Goodman (@GoodmanJonathan) July 20, 2015 if you are interested in #economics, then it is worth listening Banned TED Talk: Nick Hanauer 'Rich people don't... http://t.co/00E6rlPF1g Mudassar Bashir (@mb62020) June 15, 2015 Nick Hanauer too politically controversial : rich people don t create jobs, consumers do - via Reese Jones http://t.co/9xzs0vn1kz V rit TV (@Verite_TV) June 11, 2015 In late May 2012 a contributor to TED's forums specifically asked why Hanauer's talk had been \"banned,\" prompting a lengthy discussion during the course of which individuals affiliated with TED linked to a statement issued by TED curator Chris Anderson on why Hanauer's talk had not been promoted. The service by which Anderson published the explanation (Posterous) shuttered in April 2013, taking Anderson's remarks with it. However, a cached version revealed the date (17 May 2012), title (\"TED and inequality: The real story\"), and content of Anderson's rebuttal. Anderson opened by stating that \"TED was subject to a story so misleading it would be funny... except it successfully launched an aggressive online campaign against us.\" He described an ensuing \"firestorm of outrage\" on sites including Reddit and Huffington Post, wherein TED was \"accused of being cowards ... in the pay of our corporate partners ... [and] the despicable puppets of the Republican party.\" Anderson's account of the decision not to release Hanauer's talk differed dramatically from the circulating rumors: Here's what actually happened. At TED this year, an attendee pitched a 3-minute audience talk on inequality. The talk tapped into a really important and timely issue. But it framed the issue in a way that was explicitly partisan. (The talk is explicitly attacking what he calls an article of faith for Republicans. He criticizes Democrats too, but only for not also attacking this idea more often.) And it included a number of arguments that were unconvincing, even to those of us who supported his overall stance, such as the apparent ruling out of entrepreneurial initiative as a root cause of job creation. The audience at TED who heard it live (and who are often accused of being overly enthusiastic about left-leaning ideas) gave it, on average, mediocre ratings some enthusiastic, others critical. At TED we post one talk a day on our home page. We're drawing from a pool of 250+ that we record at our own conferences each year and up to 10,000 recorded at the various TEDx events around the world, not to mention our other conference partners. Our policy is to post only talks that are truly special. And we try to steer clear of talks that are bound to descend into the same dismal partisan head-butting people can find every day elsewhere in the media. We discussed internally and ultimately told the speaker we did not plan to post. He did not react well. He had hired a PR firm to promote the talk to MoveOn and others, and the PR firm warned us that unless we posted he would go to the press and accuse us of censoring him. We again declined and this time I wrote him and tried gently to explain in detail why I thought his talk was flawed. So he forwarded portions of the private emails to a reporter and the National Journal duly bit on the story. And it was picked up by various other outlets. As Anderson noted, income inequality was the subject of at least one [uncensored] TED Talk video in 2011. Much of the rumor regarding Nick Hanauer's purportedly banned TED Talk segment hinged upon the differing assertions made by TED and Nick Hanauer at the time of the controversy in 2012. However, Anderson's claims (that TED curators are tasked with promoting only the most impactful clips) weren't implausible or suggestive of a coverup. It would be difficult to determine whether Hanauer or anyone working on his behalf threatened a public relations offensive, but TED maintained that quality and not content was behind the decision not to feature the video (which clearly was not \"banned\" from public view but was simply not promoted by TED). Since the time of the initial debate over whether or why the TED talk was \"banned,\" the clip has been distributed both by TED and other outlets and widely viewed by a large online audience. In August 2014, Hanauer returned for a TED Talk titled \"Beware, fellow plutocrats, the pitchforks are coming.\" While it's true that TED opted not to promote Hanauer's initial appearance (during which he discussed income inequality) his segment was not banned, and the organization cited his lack of substantive content alongside his primary reliance on partisan ideas as the reason it was not curated alongside other featured TED Talks. At no point during the immediate controversy did TED appear to deny the existence of the video, remove it from the Internet, interfere with its distribution, or otherwise thwart the ideas advocated by Hanauer from spreading. The group simply chose initially not to promote the clip (as they doe for a large number of TED Talks) in favor of other content selected by their curators.

A July 2014 article from the Better Business Bureau illustrated how folks might spot and avoid bad actors utilizing the reputations of brands on social media: Don't believe what you see. It's easy to steal the colors, logos and header of an established organization. Scammers can also make links look like they lead to legitimate websites and emails appear to come from a different sender. Legitimate businesses do not ask for credit card numbers or banking information on customer surveys. If they do ask for personal information, like an address or email, be sure there's a link to their privacy policy. When in doubt, do a quick web search. If the survey is a scam, you may find alerts or complaints from other consumers. The organization's real website may have further information. Watch out for a reward that's too good to be true. If the survey is real, you may be entered in a drawing to win a gift card or receive a small discount off your next purchase. Few businesses can afford to give away $50 gift cards for completing a few questions.

the former town of Belakwa, New York, which was supposed;y abandoned in 2012 after \"a 'routine' hydrofracking operation left its soil toxic and its aquifer irreparable,\" along with a comment stating: Oh, yeah. Fracking is totally harmless.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Iterations of the image (and the sign's claims that Belakwa, New York had been abandoned due to hydrofracking) date to at least 2013, when photographs of the sign were circulated on social media with additional context: ON THIS SITE STOOD the town of BELAKWA, NY. It was abandoned in 2012 after a \"routine\" hydrofracking operation left its soil toxic and its aquifer irreprable. \"Belakwa\" = \"Bella Aqua\" = \"Beautiful Water\" Great new street art project being done in upstate NY. This siting is in Bearsville, NY outside of Woodstock, NY. As the poster correctly observed, the sign was part of a larger series of works by artist Norm Magnusson. In 2007, the New York Times profiled Magnusson's eye-catching project, rendered in the style of the state's iconic historical markers: The blue and yellow sign along Main Street in Ridgefield looked a lot like a historical marker, but something wasn t quite right. Rather than commemorate a famous person who had stood there, or an event that had shaped history, the marker honored the role of dissent in the functioning of a \"healthy democracy.\" Mr. Magnusson is an artist-activist. His cast aluminum markers focus our attention on pressing contemporary social and political issues, often restating the concerns or comments of ordinary Americans in carefully composed messages that are designed to make you think. Magnusson's subject matter is exceedingly broad, ranging across a variety of topical issues, including global warming, the war in Iraq and the debate over evolution and intelligent design. His candor is pitiless and unsparing, showing no fear or favor to any particular ideology. Magnusson's work utilizes a standard format for historical markers in New York State: No town or other settlement by the name of Belakwa ever existed in New York State. A Google Maps search on the location returned a result pointing to the museum in which Magnusson's work was displayed.

While the gallery featured several images of paintings, awards, and certificates on the walls of Dr. Carson's house, one particular portrait of Dr. Carson posing with Jesus caught the eye of social media users: Ben Carson's house is filled with his awards and pictures, like this one of him with Jesus https://t.co/8GItclguFg pic.twitter.com/k2slHIYRfw", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Peter Feld (@peterfeld) November 7, 2015 Some people found the choice of home decor peculiar, and since many viewers came across the portrait of Dr. Ben Carson and Jesus through social media posts and not via a news article, many of them wondered if the photograph was real. While we haven't been able to locate an image of the portrait other than the one offered by the Guardian, we were able to track down confirmation from another publication that a portrait of Ben Carson and Jesus did indeed hang on the neurosurgeon's walls. In 2009, Baltimore Magazine published a profile of Carson which included a description of his home, referenced the portrait in question, and noted that the imagery of the picture was consistent with Dr. Carson's expressions of faith: The family room, where Carson likes to unwind over games of pool, ping pong, and foosball, is a sort of makeshift museum of the man known for his gifted hands, and [his wife] Candy is both keeper and curator. A quick glance at the cases and walls reveals more than 50 honorary doctorate degrees from such institutions as Spelman College, Morgan State University, and Yale as well as certificates, trophies, and statues from numerous preeminent organizations. The [couple's] strong faith is also a guiding force. \"We are very spiritual people so you will see a lot of Bibles around the house and things that are indicative of that,\" says Carson, who attends a Seventh Day Adventist Church in Silver Spring. \"I don't have to be politically correct here.\" He points to a stained-glass window in his foyer, a painting of him with Jesus, and his favorite proverb over the fireplace \"By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life\" Proverbs 22:4.

a woman fantasizing about rape. After Sanders gained political prominence as a presidential candidate in 2015, that essay was brought to wider attention in a profile of Sanders published by Mother Jones on 26 May 2015: What Sanders did share with the young radicals and hippies flocking to Vermont was a smoldering idealism forged during his college years as a civil rights activist he coordinated a sit-in against segregated housing and attended the 1963 March on Washington but only a fuzzy sense of how to act on it. Sanders bounced back and forth between Vermont and New York City, where he worked at a psychiatric hospital. After his marriage broke up in the late 1960s, he moved to an A-frame farmhouse outside the Vermont town of Stannard, a tiny hamlet with no paved roads in the buckle of the commune belt. He dabbled in carpentry and tried to get by as a freelance journalist for alternative newspapers and regional publications, contributing interviews, political screeds, and, one time, a stream-of-consciousness essay on the nature of male-female sexual dynamics:", "Fact Check": "Did Bernie Sanders write an essay in which a woman fantasizes about being \"raped by three men simultaneously\"?", "Description": "That essay sparked a debate about Sanders and his views on women, and conservative outlets such as Young Cons, reproduced a portion of the essay in an attempt to illustrate how it was hypocritical for liberals to demonize Republicans for waging a \"War on Women\" when Sanders had written about a rape fantasy in a 1972 essay: According to liberals with IQs smaller than their sock size, conservative presidential candidates absolutely LOATHE women, hate them with a passion even. Those mean, old, white guys which is a hilarious stereotype given there's latinos, blacks, and women in the top spots for the GOP want nothing more than to destroy women s health care by defunding the ghoulish Planned Parenthood, and encourage rape culture with their antiquated views on gender roles. None of this is actually true, of course, but when have facts ever got in the way of the liberal agenda? What should really make you scratch your head is how lefties will rake conservatives over the coals for the things mentioned above, yet say absolutely nothing about this atrocious Bernie Sanders quote: But of course, plenty of publications on both sides of the political spectrum have said a good deal about \"this atrocious Bernie Sanders quote.\" NPR, for example, reported that: The essay by the Vermont senator isn't long only a page. The bit about rape comes at the very beginning, as does some not-totally-safe-for-work language: A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees, a woman tied up, a woman abused. A woman enjoys intercourse with her man as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously. The man and woman get dressed up on Sunday and go to Church, or maybe to their 'revolutionary' political meeting. Have you ever looked at the Stag, Man, Hero, Tough magazines on the shelf of your local bookstore? Do you know why the newspaper with the articles like 'Girl 12 raped by 14 men' sell so well? To what in us are they appealing? Sanders Sanders then goes on to explain his ideas about gender roles and eventually gets at a sharper point that traditional gender roles help create troubling dynamics in men's and women's sex lives. \"Many women seem to be walking a tightrope,\" he writes, as their \"qualities of love, openness, and gentleness were too deeply enmeshed with qualities of dependency, subservience, and masochism.\" One way to read the essay is that Sanders was doing (in a supremely ham-handed way) what journalists do every day: draw the reader in with an attention-getting lede, then get to the meat of the article in the middle. You can draw divergent conclusions from the article itself. On the one hand, he's talking about liberating people from harmful gender norms. On the other, with his nameless hypothetical \"man-and-woman\" characters, he also seems to imply that men fantasize about raping women or that women fantasize about being raped. CNN also covered the controversial essay in a piece that quoted Sanders' campaign spokesman describing it as \"stupid\" and a \"dumb attempt at dark satire\": Michael Briggs, Sanders' campaign spokesman, said the article was a \"dumb attempt at dark satire in an alternative publication\" that \"in no way reflects his views or record on women. It was intended to attack gender stereotypes of the '70s, but it looks as stupid today as it was then.\" Last updated: 22 September 2015", "Originally Published": " 22 September 2015", "Referred Links": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/28/politics/bernie-sanders-rape-essay-1972/index.html;http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/05/29/410606045/the-bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy-essay-explained;http://www.youngcons.com/this-bernie-sanders-quote-about-rape-should-horrify-women-everywhere/;http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/young-bernie-sanders-liberty-union-vermont;", "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, September 2015] This quote about rape has been attributed to Bernie Sanders.

29 August 2015, a Tumblr user re-blogged a \"note\" about Adolf Hitler and World War II (originally shared by another user), appendeding a claim about the parents of former Vermont senator (and Democratic presidential candidate) Bernie Sanders' parents being Holocaust survivors: \"A guy named Adolf Hitler won an election in 1932.", "Fact Check": "Were Bernie Sanders' parents Holocaust survivors?", "Description": "He won an election, and 50 million people died as a result of that election in World War II, including 6 million Jews. So what I learned as a little kid is that politics is, in fact, very important.\" Bernie Sanders parents are Holocaust survivors by the way. Both posts (which between them accumulated a quarter of a million comments) linked to an 11 June 2015 Christian Science Monitor article that focused on then-current online rumor claiming that Sanders maintained dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship. In that article, Sanders mentioned that his father had emigrated from Poland but did not describe his parents as Holocaust survivors: Chances are, Sanders's religion would not have come up at the Monitor breakfast, except for a controversy the day before. During an interview broadcast by NPR, host Diane Rehm had asserted, mistakenly, that Sanders was a dual US-Israeli citizen. He immediately corrected her, calling it \"nonsense that goes on in the Internet.\" But Ms. Rehm pressed on and asked about other members of Congress. Sanders took offense. \"I honestly don't know but I have read that on the Internet. You know, my dad came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket. He loved this country. I am, you know, I got offended a little bit by that comment, and I know it's been on the Internet. I am obviously an American citizen, and I do not have any dual citizenship.\" Similarly, a 21 January 2007 New York Times magazine article on Sanders reported that Sanders' father Eli came from Poland and \"saw his family wiped out in the Holocaust,\" but did not state that Eli Sanders himself was a Holocaust survivor: Sanders's parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland. His father, Eli, a struggling paint salesman who saw his family wiped out in the Holocaust, worried constantly about supporting his wife and two sons. His mother, Dorothy, dreamed of living in a \"private home,\" but they never made it beyond their three-and-a-half-room apartment on East 26th and Kings Highway. She died at age 46, when Bernie was 19. \"Sensitivity to class was imbedded in me then quite deeply,\" Sanders told me. On 25 July 2015, the Sanders for President campaign released a five-minute long video spot titled \"Progress,\" in which (at the 30-second mark) Sanders briefly stated that his mother was born in New York (not Poland) and had died young: Tablet magazine published an in-depth piece on Sanders on 20 August 2015 that provided additional detail about Sanders' parents, reporting that Eli Sanders' immigrated to the U.S. in 1921, well before the outbreak of World War II and the horrors of the Holocaust (although a number of Eli Sanders' relatives who remained in Poland perished in concentration camps years later): Bernie Sanders is a typical American Jew of his generation in that his story doesn't hew to any preconceived narratives or stereotypes, except for the fact that it begins in Brooklyn, where he and his brother Larry grew up in a modest apartment located off Kings Highway. Like many Brooklyn families, the Sanderses aspired to become middle-class Americans while living in the shadow of the Holocaust. In 1921, Larry and Bernie s father, Eli, left his family in Slopnice, a rural village in the South of Poland, and immigrated to the United States. During the Nazi occupation of Poland, Slopnice's wide-open fields were used for airdrops before the businesses and goods of the town's local Jews were closed and confiscated. Most of Eli's family was sent to concentration camps where they were killed. \"Politics was not an aside [for us],\" Larry Sanders has said. \"It was life or death.\" In late May 2015, Bernie Sanders covered the same biographic ground during a speech in Burlington, Vermont: My father came to this country from Poland without a penny in his pocket and without much of an education. My mother graduated high school in New York City. My father worked for almost his entire life as a paint salesman and we were solidly lower-middle class. My parents, brother and I lived in a small rent-controlled apartment. My mother s dream was to move out of that small apartment into a home of our own. She died young, and her dream was never fulfilled. As a kid I learned, in many, many ways, every day, what lack of money means to a family, and that is a lesson I have never forgotten and never will. So while Bernie Sanders' father, Eli Sanders, immigrated to the United States from Poland, he did so back in 1921 thus could not accurately be described as a Holocaust survivor under even the broadest definitions of the term. Sanders' mother, Dorothy Sanders, was born in New York City and thus was neither an immigrant nor a potential victim of Nazi death camps.

Although apparently intended as a joke (since the image doesn't make much sense to a viewer unfamiliar with its context), the photograph's accompanying description has been taken seriously by some viewers even though: This photograph is quite obviously a cropped version of an image taken from the classic 1975 musical comedy horror film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, picturing actors Tim Curry, Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon. Despite the falsity of this image, Bernie Sanders has in fact been a supporter of LGBT rights for many years: Senator Sanders has been a longtime supporter of LGBT rights. In 1983, during his first term as Mayor of Burlington, Sen. Sanders supported the city s first ever Pride Parade. He later signed a city ordinance banning housing discrimination. Sen. Sanders is currently a cosponsor of the Equality Act, which would expand the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other anti-discrimination laws to include protections for sexual orientation and gender identity. He has consistently supported legislation that would guarantee LGBT Americans would be treated as equal citizens, and has a lifetime perfect score from the Human Rights Campaign.

September 2015 the humor site The Good Lord Above published an article reporting that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders had saved three children and a dog from a house fire, but the U.S. news media had curiously ignored the story: Bernie Sanders is recovering Friday after saving 3 children and a dog from a house that was on fire.", "Fact Check": "Did Bernie Sanders save a dog from a burning building in a rescue ignored by the media?", "Description": "Local fire officials say the 74-year-old Bernie Sanders, a democratic candidate for president, was on a campaign march through town when he noticed smoke coming from a house down the block. Once he was sure the kids were safe, officials say Sanders entered the burning home again to rescue the family dog. Despite the incredibly heroic actions of Bernie Sanders, the news media has completely ignored this story because it would go against the wishes of their corporate masters. Details in the article hinted at The Good Lord Above's satirical intent: the fire's cause was attributed to a child attempting to cook because both parents were working, and a home insurance policy purportedly wouldn't compensate the family because they were \"too poor.\" (Two strong positions held by Sanders are support for workers' rights and broad condemnation of corporate abuses.) Moreover, the reason provided for the story's absence from the news was the objection of \"corporate masters\" whom readers are meant to infer stand in opposition of Sanders' candidacy. Unlike most \"fake news\" sites, The Good Lord Above's scope largely spans obviously satirical content supposedly written from God's perspective. Prior articles include \"After 2000 Years of Silence, God Launches New Website,\" \"GOD: I'm finally off drugs and it feels good,\" and \"Trump Calls Jesus 'A Loser.'\" While the web site does not include a readily available disclaimer, the site's Facebook page makes it clear that all articles published on The Good Lord Above are humorous in nature: God made the world. Then he flooded it. Then God went to sleep for about 2000 years. Anyway, eventually God woke up and felt pretty bad for what he'd done in the past. In 2011, after years of therapy, God started this Holy and Divine God Facebook Page to restore his good name.

"Example": "[Collected via Facebook, February 2016] Origin:In response to a political image criticizing Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders for only paying his interns $12 an hour while advocating for an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour (an issue that referenced his U.S. Senate staff rather than his presidential campaign staff), another political image circulated in February 2016 claimed that the \"socialist\" presidential candidate was the only one to pay his campaign interns anything at all. This image was likely inspired by a December 2015 Washington Post article which reported that Sanders was the only one of 16 presidential candidates (in any party) currently paying his campaign interns: In August, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton tweeted an application for unpaid interns, requiring a r sum and two letters of reference. Just a few days later, she was posting about the student debt crisis. On the Republican side, former Florida governor Jeb Bush has called the opportunity gap \"the defining issue of our time,\" and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has railed against \"upward-mobility stagnation.\" Like Clinton, both of them have proposals to reduce student debt. Even retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson wants public universities to pay the interest on student loans, while business mogul Donald Trump has accused the federal government of profiting off students. But of the 16 candidates running for president, only one pays his interns: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), at $10.10 an hour. While it may be generally accurate to say that Bernie Sanders is one of the few (if not the only) 2016 presidential candidate paying his interns, a few exceptions and clarifications that should be noted. First, the candidates offering unpaid internships are not breaking any laws. In most cases, it is perfectly legal to hire interns for non-paying positions as long as those interns receive some tangible benefit (such as school credit or valuable work experience) in return. Second, some candidates, such as Republican Ben Carson, do offer their interns others forms of compensation, such as stipends for food or travel. And neither we nor the Washington Post have been able to determine if GOP candidate Donald Trump's campaigns offers internships (or, if so, whether those internships are paid positions), although we note that interns at Trump Entertainment Resorts are reportedly paid $10 an hour. The campaign teams of Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie have all recently posted advertisements seeking interns for non-paying positions. A recent posting on Bernie Sanders' web site, on the other hand, advertises a paid internship position (although such ads do not necessarily indicate that all campaign internship positions are paying ones): Bernie 2016 is currently looking for a full-time Digital Intern. This position will require working directly with the Digital and Social Media Directors. This is a paid internship based in Washington, D.C. Unpaid internships are quite common in politics. A 2013 study by the Atlantic found that only one-third of U.S. senators paid their interns. That article also criticized Democratic senators for being more stingy in their use of unpaid interns while singling out Bernie Sanders (technically an independent) as an exception to the rule: [E]mbarrassingly, the vast majority of senators who do pay [their interns] are Republicans. Of those 35 senators [who pay their interns], only 11 are Democrats meaning almost 80 percent of Dems require volunteer participation (not counting Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats). This is peculiar and troubling for a party that elsewhere signals its commitment to fair pay, equal representation, economic inequality, and workplace welfare. When it comes to interns in the Senate, it seems that traditional beliefs about labor and economic opportunity are suddenly switched. Although President Obama is not pictured in the above-displayed image (since he is not a candidate in the 2016 presidential campaign), we also note that White House internships provide neither pay nor housing for those who fill such positions.

entitled Breaking History: Bigfoot Captured, a program that purportedly documented a successful hunt and capture of the legendary creature:", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Bigfoot is America's most legendary creature, and has always inspired more questions than answers. Could something resembling a massive man-ape really be roaming forests and hiding in the shadows undetected? Whether you believe in Bigfoot or not, there's something provocative about the idea that we could be living with an unseen monster. But what if one day we did more than catch a glimpse of one? What if we captured the creature? This two-hour special, compiled by a director who traveled the world looking for proof Bigfoot actually exists, takes an unexpected turn when a Sasquatch capture is caught on camera. What happens when what most of us think is fiction becomes fact? And what does it mean for us all if the creature really is out there. While the program started with a brief disclaimer stating that Breaking History: Bigfoot Captured featured \"some dramatization\" and ended with credits listing various actors who pretended to be Bigfoot hunters, the episode was presented in documentary form and therefore fooled a number of viewers into believing that a Bigfoot creature had actually been captured during the process of filming. This is not the case. The actors on \"Bigfoot Captured\" didn't actually catch a Sasquatch or uncover a Bigfoot skeleton. According to the Idaho State Journal, the History Channel contracted Idaho State University's Robotics and Communication Systems Engineering Technology program to create a skeleton of the mythical beast to be used in the show: Because no actual Bigfoot skeletons have been unearthed, [ISU anthropology and anatomy professor Jeff] Meldrum had to reconstruct it based on what Bigfoot researchers believe the creature is related to. Meldrum borrowed from the physical looks of extinct animals such as the Gigantopithecus blacki an ancient ape that was twice the size of apes today and the Neanderthal a species of human that is said to have became extinct 40,000 years ago. Meldrum took the Neanderthal skeleton, and technicians from the Idaho Virtualization Laboratory on ISU's campus under Meldrum's guidance digitally manipulated the skeleton to reflect the Bigfoot captured in the famous Patterson-Gimlin film. \"They made the shoulders much broader, the torso thicker, the arms longer, the legs the right proportion,\" Meldrum said. \"Then we took the Neanderthal skull away because it's more human-like.\" In other words, Breaking History: Bigfoot Captured was not a documentary, but rather a fictional work created in fake documentary style for entertainment purposes, just like the fake Animal Planet \"documentary\" on mermaids and the fake Discovery Channel \"documentary\" about megalodon.

President began circulating via email and online message boards. Most iterations of the essay were titled \"An Interesting Take On Trump,\" \"DONALD TRUMP: WHAT THEY ALL FEAR MOST!\" or \" \"What I See Happening In a Trump Presidency\" and attributed to conservative commentator Bill Bennett: They will kill him before they let him be president. It could be a Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump. Don't be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting very nervous: Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "It's about the unholy dynamics between big government, big business, and big media.They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this partnership, and it's in all of their interests to protect one another. It's one for all and all for one. It's a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich, everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We're the patsies. But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened like never before. Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no joke. He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart. It's no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. It's because most of the other politicians are part of the a ood old boys club. They talk big, but they won't change a thing. They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, and multinational corporations ... like Big Pharma or Big Oil. The above-quoted essay was not written by Bill Bennett. It was originally posted on the web site Reality News Media on 17 September 2015 and circulated for several weeks with no attribution attached to it. It wasn't until mid-November 2015 that Bill Bennett's named started to appear alongside the title in an apparent attempt to lend credibility to the essay. Bennett's views on Donald Trump are not in line with those expressed in the essay. While the unknown author writes that Trump would make a good President since he is self-funded and does not play by the rules, Bennett said in an interview with Sean Hannity that he was not okay with a Trump presidency: Because I look at a man and the totality of his acts and his record and the things he has and stood for. And I think, probably, he's not very principled in terms of his convictions anyway, except he, you know, is a businessman who does things his way, his own idiosyncratic way. I do understand the appeal. People are angry, mad. And he seems big enough to kind of encompass that anger ... ... Here's Trump with a record, you know, longer than your arm, wrong on all these things, getting all this support. That's what makes me a little angry and makes me think there's a lot of irrationality on it... ... Look, if Trump's the nominee, Sean, I will support him because I won't support Hillary.

Is it true? Origin:On 2 January 2015, the entertainment web site Viral Time Lapse posted an item reporting that comedian Bill Cosby had killed himself in reaction to the news that criminal sexual assault charges had been brought against him: Actor and comedian Bill Cosby, who has recently been charged with sexual assault, was found dead this morning of an apparent suicide in his Philadelphia, Pennsylvania home. He was 78. His death has been reported as \"a suicide due to asphyxia.\" Philadelphia police confirmed that Cosby committed suicide by hanging himself with a rope. Cosby was discovered by his wife and left no suicide note. \"Bill Cosby passed away this morning,\" his reps said in a statement. \"He has been battling sexual assault accusations of late. This is a tragic and sudden loss. The family respectfully asks for their privacy as they grieve during this very difficult time.\" There was no truth to this story, as Viral Time Lapse is a \"satire\" (i.e., fake news) site that does not publish factual stories. A disclaimer on Viral Time Lapse notes that the site's articles are \"entirely fictional\": Viral Time Lapse shall not be responsible for any incorrect or inaccurate information, whether caused by website users or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in this website or by any technical or human error which may occur. Viral Time Lapse assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website even those based on real people are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle. Bill Cosby was indeed charged with sexual assault (although as of 4 January 2016 the comedian was still among the living). According to a CNN report, Cosby posted $1 million bail, and Cosby's attorney asserted that his client would fight the charges: Hours after Bill Cosby set foot in a Pennsylvania courtroom to face sexual assault charges, the comedian's attorneys called the criminal case against him \"unjustified\" and vowed to fight it. \"The charge by the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office came as no surprise, filed 12 years after the alleged incident and coming on the heels of a hotly contested election for this county's DA during which this case was made the focal point,\" Cosby's attorneys said in a statement released after his arraignment Wednesday. \"Make no mistake, we intend to mount a vigorous defense against this unjustified charge and we expect that Mr. Cosby will be exonerated by a court of law.\" Several rumors have circulated in the wake of Cosby's indictment, including the false claim that the comedian's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame had been removed.

While the meme has been shared with various photos and on several different platforms, there is no evidence that the comedian actually uttered the above-quoted phrase. The quote \"I m suspicious of people who don t like dogs, but I trust a dog when it doesn't like a person,\" was a popular meme long before Murray's name was attached to it. While the exact origins of the phrase are unknown, the earliest mention of the phrase on Twitter that we could uncover was posted in October 2011: Murray's name didn't become attached to the phrase until November 2014, when it was posted by a parody account: The @BillMurray Twitter account makes it clear that it is not run by the comedian: I AM NOT BILL MURRAY. This is a parody account. This account is not in any way affiliated with the actor Bill Murray While the above-displayed quote has been attributed to Bill Murray on IMDB, The Daily Quotes, and dozens of social media memes, there is no record of the comedian actually uttering the above-displayed phrase.

reporting that hotel mogul James Horton was offering to pay one thousand women $10,000 per month each, for life, to bear his children and help him create the world's largest family: Jewish Hotel mogul James Horton wants to have the biggest family in the world. So much so that he has offered to pay $10,000 each month for life to any woman that has a child with him.", "Fact Check": "Is Jewish hotel mogul James Horton recruiting one thousand women to bear his children and create \"the biggest family in the world\"?", "Description": "Horton has offered to house 1000 women in one of his 5 star hotels for up to 2 years while he conceives a child with any woman he chooses. Horton has had over 22,000 entries and has selected around 250 women so far. Horton has said that he will be selecting women based on their looks from pictures they submit to his website. After the initial selection, the candidates are invited to his mansion in Beverly Hills, where she will then go through an interview process with Horton. If they pass this test, they go through a medical screening process and tested for any STD s. After selection, the lucky lady then moves into his 5 star hotel, where Horton will copulate with all the women until they are pregnant. There is no truth to the above-displayed story. While Link Beef does not include a readily available disclaimer on their site indicating they are purveyors of fake news, several factors identify this article as fiction: First, \"Jewish Hotel Mogul James Horton\" doesn't seem to exist. The only mention of his name on the Internet is connected to the above-quoted article. Second, the photographs included in the article are not related to \"James Horton\" nor to the women he has supposedly selected to create the world's biggest family. The first image shows the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills (part of Montage Hotels & Resorts founded in 2002 by Alan Fuerstman) and not a hotel owned by \"James Horton\": The second image is a promotional photograph for Wonderbra's Multiplunge bra and not, as claimed by Link Beef, the \"250 ladies Horton already selected posed for a photo shoot yesterday\": In addition to deceiving readers with a fake news article, Link Beef also claimed that Horton had set up a web site at the domain BillionaireBaby.org in order to receive applications from prospective female \"family members\" interesting in bearing his children: Although it's unclear who owns BillionaireBaby.org or what intent of the web site is (beyond something set up merely to lend credence to a fake news story), it's highly unlikely that anyone submitting photographs to it will get to experience an extended stay at a luxury hotel, a large monetary stipend, and impregnation by a fictional billionaire hotel mogul. Link Beef has previously published fake stories about a gang member attempting to gold plate his genitals, a \"lab-grown\" baby, and a castaway being rescued with the help of Google Earth.

taxpayer funds. This is supposed to improve the graduation rate for young, black men by enabling them to spend more time with each other. It seems a bit \"hinky\" to me. It's not being covered by any mainstream news outlets, and a visit to UCONN's website, while it reveals several initiatives for Black History Month, doesn't say a word. This looks like it needs some of your famous debunking. For me, it doesn't quite pass the \"sniff test.\" There are lots of Google links to be had by searching for \"uconn black dorm,\" but as I said, none seem reliable. Thanks!! An all black dorm? Boy this country has really gone to hell in recent years after we elected a black president. Race... Posted by John F Gallagher on Sunday, January 31, 2016 An all black dorm? Boy this country has really gone to hell in recent years after we elected a black president. Race... Posted by John F Gallagher on Sunday, January 31, 2016 Origin:On 31 January 2016, The Blaze published an article with a headline indicating that the University of Connecticut was building a dorm to house black students only: In order to help black males graduate, the University of Connecticut is constructing a dorm with a living space only for them. Called the ScHOLA2RS House, the living community for African American males is set to open in 2016. According to UConn's website, the ScHOLA2RS House is \"a scholastic initiative to groom, nurture, and train the next generation of leaders to address grand challenges in society through the promotion of academic success in undergraduate programs at the University of Connecticut and in competitive graduate programs.\" Fox News' Fox Nation aggregated a snippet of a separate web site's article on the same date, with the sole visible excerpt stating that: The University of Connecticut is hoping that black males will graduate at a higher rate if they spend more time with one another, and is building a new residence hall to facilitate just that. Many readers expressed skepticism regarding the accuracy of the claim and reported an inability to locate any such initiative announced or described on UConn's web site or the school's social media channels. We contacted UConn's Residential Life department to ask whether any construction for a \"blacks only\" dorm was underway. They confirmed the only new housing being built was for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) students of all ethnicities. An undated document published among UConn's learning initiatives included a \"Mission\" portion that read: ScHOLA RS House is a Learning Community designed to support the scholastic efforts of male students who identify as African American/Black through academic and social/emotional support, access to research opportunities, and professional development. The intent of this Learning Community is to increase the retention and persistence of students using educational and social experiences to enhance their academic success at UConn and beyond in graduate and professional school placement. ScHOLA RS House will encourage involvement with the larger university community to foster peer and mentor relationships and will actively engage students in inclusion efforts at UConn. Some of the material from that document appeared to be the source for articles about a \"blacks-only dorm\" linked above. However, a question and answer section of that document expressly stated that ScHOLA RS program participants wouldn't be living in a facility where they were segregated from other students: If I apply to live in ScHOLA RS House, will I be segregated from the rest of campus? No. Typically, students do not spend their days in their residence hall. Students are in classes across campus, they participate in student organizations, they apply for leadership opportunities and work in offices across campus, they study in the library, they share meals in several dining halls, and so forth. A student s Learning Community is simply a cohort of students they engage in activities with, such as they would if they joined another organization. It will not encompass a student s entire college experience. What it will do is provide a group of faculty, staff and students who support each other and encourage the success of its members academically, professionally, and socially. In addition, the 40 ScHOLA RS House students will live on a floor of over 100 students, so they will engage easily with students from all backgrounds in their residence hall. A separate portion of the document explained that the cohort would be housed together along with other learning communities: Students who apply to participate in the ScHOLA RS House program will live in NextGen Hall, sharing a floor with Innovation House students. NextGen Hall will house over 700 students participating in 8 Learning Communities, providing ample opportunity to engage with students from across majors, interests, and backgrounds: EcoHouse; Engineering House; Eurotech House; STEM Honors House; Innovation House; ScHOLA RS House; Public Health House; and WiMSE House (Women in Math, Science & Engineering). Each Learning Community is led by a team, including a faculty director, graduate assistants, a residence hall director, student resident assistants, and student mentors. Students participating enroll in a one-credit Learning Community-themed FYE (first year experience) course or a one-credit sophomore course and engage in activities throughout the academic year. We contacted UConn's Dr. Erik Hines for clarification on the rumor, and he provided a number of details omitted in circulating news reports: Twelve students already have contacted us with interest in living in Scholars House. Participation is, of course, entirely voluntary and its programming will be open to all in the University community, not only black male students. This living community will also be located in the new Next Gen Hall when it opens this fall, so Scholars House students will live among 700-plus other students from all backgrounds while at the same time having access to specialized educational and social experiences to encourage success in their college careers. To correct misinformation that some have unwittingly spread, this learning community will not be separate, nor is the building only going to house this group of students. Rather, this will be one of several learning communities whose residents live in Next Gen Hall, along with other students who aren't in learning communities. Also to clarify, this is not UConn's first learning community with a focus on a specific race or gender. For instance, La Comunidad Intelectual is a thriving community in Brock Hall, and WiMSE (Women in Math, Science and Engineering), located in Watson Hall, is one of our first and consistently most popular. If other students are interested in a similar residential experience, we are always open to looking at more communities to add to those already on campus. In fact, we've made a commitment to expand our learning communities, so we encourage students to bring their ideas to us, and to help us develop the kinds of housing experiences they would find valuable. The claim that UConn was constructing a special dorm for black students only was false: The learning community ScHOLA RS House is only one of many such academic communities on campus, participants aren't required to be black, and it is open to anyone who wants to be a part of it.

article titled \"Clint TX Residents Report Forced Micro-chipping by Jade Helm Operatives.\" According to that article, inhabitants of that Lone Star State town were being forcibly rounded up and implanted with microchips by soldiers taking part in the Jade Helm 15 military exercise: People in the town of Clint, Texas are reporting that American soldiers have rounded up hundreds of civilians and forced them to submit to RFID implantation.", "Fact Check": "Have Residents of Clint, Texas, been forcibly implanted with microchips by Jade Helm operatives?", "Description": "Currently Jade Helm 15 is operating just miles outside of Clint, Texas, leaving many to wonder if the two are related. Jade Helm has been steeped in controversy since it was first announced by the military on March 23 2015, and concerned Texans have been on high alert for a potential gun-grab, or martial law scenario ever since. The governor of Texas has even deployed the National Guard to defend against any potential hostile takeover attempts. The US government has described Jade Helm as a military training exercise which focuses on specific terrains, but folks remain skeptical, and with good reason. Several eye witness reports state that residents in the small town were rounded up and brought to an abandoned shopping mall in the area. There they were given the choice between RFID implantation, or imprisonment in the makeshift military base. While United Media Publishing's web site doesn't feature a disclaimer identifying its content as fake news, prior efforts from the outlet include the fabricated claims that Charles Manson had died and that thousands of Christian couples were filing for divorce to protest the Supreme Court's ruling on gay marriage.

"Example": "[Collected via Email, February 2016] Saw this on Facebook. Sounds made up. Can't find any evidence of it online. Origin:On 10 February 2016, the \"Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3\" Facebook page relayed a report about two Maryland sheriff's deputies who were shot and killed after approaching a homeless man at a restaurant: Earlier today, law enforcement officers was dispatched to a call of an older, disheveled, apparently homeless, suspicious subject who was sitting in a restaurant without having ordered any food. The first deputy responding to the call reportedly approached the subject, and in an attempt to treat him with humanizing kindness and compassion, sat down to him and asked the man how his day was going. The man responded by putting a gun to the deputy's temple and pulling the trigger. He then proceeded outside, where he killed another responding deputy sheriff. For those of you who have not worn a badge, please remember this case. The next time you interact with a police officer (or Sheriff's deputy), the next time you witness someone else interacting with the cops, before you criticize the officer for not being as friendly as you think they should be, before you judge his or her demeanor as being cold, condescending, or excessively cautious, before you accuse them of overreacting or countering resistance or force with brutality, please remember this case. Because there's a good chance that officer does. There's a good chance they knew, remember, or heard about the deputy who was murdered in cold blood for simply being polite. This message was accurate (if incomplete), although many readers were skeptical of the account since it was reported as \"seen in a recent FB post\" from an anonymous user. The information in that post echoed details found in February 2016 news reports about the shooting deaths of two Maryland sheriff's deputies who responded to a call at a mall-based Panera Bread restaurant: Two longtime Harford County sheriff's deputies were shot to death in broad daylight at a busy shopping center by a man officials believe was targeting police, according to authorities. The 68-year-old suspect, whom officials described as a vagrant, was also killed in the confrontation in Abingdon, a closely knit community 30 miles northeast of Baltimore. The mayhem erupted at a Panera Bread restaurant shortly before noon in the Boulevard at Box Hill shopping center. The suspect was identified as David Brian Evans. [Sheriff Jeffrey R.] Gahler said there were two warrants for Evans' arrest a criminal warrant for allegedly assaulting a police officer in Florida and a civil warrant. Gahler said he believed Evans targeted one of the deputies inside the Panera \"because he was in a police uniform.\" The incident took about 15 minutes, officials said. It began when a deputy was shot in the head inside the restaurant about 11:45 a.m., officials said. Gahler said the deputy was responding to a call from the restaurant. He said he was unsure of the nature of the call. After shooting the deputy, the gunman fled the restaurant, officials said. Witnesses pointed other deputies toward the Park View apartments, a senior living complex next to the shopping center on Box Hill South Parkway. A deputy found the suspect outside the complex, officials said. Both the suspect and a deputy were shot. Harford County Executive Barry Glassman said Evans was an \"outsider,\" not a member of the community. \"What little we know of the suspect is that it looks like he was somewhat of a vagrant, someone who moved around a lot,\" Glassman said. \"Whether you're serving a summons or warrant, a guy like that, who has a pistol on his body in a public place and is willing to go outside and shoot an officer, is a risk to all us.\" One teenaged witness to the tragic incident at the restaurant described what she observed: \"You see this stuff in movies and online and everything on TV when it actually happens, but you never think you're going to go out to lunch one day with your mom, and it's just going to happen,\" witness 15-year-old Sophia Faulkner said. Faulkner said she was doing just that at Panera Bread. When she first walked in, she saw a man sitting in the back. \"The guy just looked a bit sketchy, and according to the waitresses or the cashiers in Panera, they said he comes in there regularly, but he's been sketchy, and they've been trying to question him and get him some help because they think he's, like, homeless,\" Faulkner said. According to the teen, a police officer approached the man. \"The police officer sitting near him said, 'How is your day?' and then immediately, according to one of the ladies, an officer that was in there apparently right after that, (the shooter) just took out his gun and shot him in the head right after the officer asked him, 'How's your day?'\" Faulkner said. Governor Larry Hogan ordered state flags lowered to half staff in honor of the two fallen officers: Anytime law enforcement or first responders lose their lives in the line of duty, it is a tragedy and today's violence in Abingdon and the deaths of two Harford County sheriff's deputies is nothing less than absolutely heartbreaking. Our administration is committed to assisting Harford County during this investigation, and the Maryland State Police are working closely with local law enforcement to provide support as needed. The First Lady and I send our most sincere thoughts and prayers to the families and loved ones of the brave deputies who made the ultimate sacrifice today for the community they selflessly served. It is my hope that their commitment and dedication to law enforcement and protecting others will be remembered and will forever serve as an inspiration to others.'\" Last updated: 11 February 2016

the possession of a covert operative for the Islamic State (ISIS), and that the documents in his possession were part of a larger plot involving ISIS, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia to invade Europe: Police officers in Bulgaria discovered boxes owned by Muslim refugees heading for Germany, they found 10,000 fake passports made in Turkey, that would have been given to terrorists.", "Fact Check": "Did Bulgaria recently uncover 10,000 fake passports that were en route to ISIS militants?", "Description": "The fact that these passports were made in Turkey show that the inundation of refugees is part of a conspiracy devised by Turkey, ISIS and Saudi Arabia ... What you are seeing in Europe is not the coming in of refugees, but an invasion. These are not refugees, but invaders. These people barging into Europe are criminals for the most part. They are coming into Europe with their anti-Christian sentiments. The article in turn cited a 9 September 2015 article on the web site The New Observer titled \"ISIS Terrorist Arrested in Stuttgart 'Refugee' Center; 'Boxes' of Fake Syrian Passports Intercepted,\" which claimed that: According to a report carried by RTL s German language service, the terrorist is a 21-year-old Moroccan using a false identity who had registered as an asylum seeker in the district of Ludwigsburg. He was identified after police linked him to a European arrest warrant issued by the Spanish authorities. He is accused of recruiting fighters for ISIS, where he acted as a contact person for fighters who wanted to travel to Syria or Iraq. This first confirmed arrest of a bogus asylum seeker came simultaneously with the admission by a German finance ministry spokesman that boxes of fake Syrian passports, destined for sale and distribution to the hordes of nonwhite invaders seeking to settle in Europe as bogus war refugees, had been seized. That news, carried in a report by the German Tagespiegel newspaper, also revealed that 10,000 fake Syrian passports were seized by police in Bulgaria, on their way to Germany. The first link in the New Observer article in turn referenced an 8 August 2015 article on German web site RTL, which dealt with the arrest of a suspected ISIS supporter but made no mention of a seizure of falsified passports: In an asylum seeker accommodation near Stuttgart a suspected supporter of the terrorist militia Islamic State (IS) has been arrested. The 21-year-old Moroccan was under suspicion of terrorism, told the Prosecutor General's Office of Stuttgart and the state police. According to the investigators, the suspect was submerged under a false identity as an asylum seeker in the district of Ludwigsburg. The New Observer also linked to an 8 September 2015 article published by German news site Der Tagesspiegel, which simply reported upon the high demand for identification documents among refugees and made no mention of the 21-year-old Moroccan man suspected of terrorism. The article noted that many refugees lacked documentation due to ongoing unrest in their homelands or sudden flight, but it didn't suggest or claim that terrorism was in any way linked to the refugees' interest in obtaining passports (real or otherwise): Fake or real Syrian passports have become a coveted commodity on the black market in Germany and other countries. In Bulgaria, the police recently 10,000 false Syrian passports safe. The documents will be sold for a lot of money to prospective customers because they are important for a successful application for asylum in the West. Many of the approximately two million Syrians who in recent years in Turkey came to have no valid identity papers more. Some lost their passports during the escape, others never had papers: The Kurds in Syria, for example, were not considered as citizens, but as stateless persons of Damascus long. The connection between the two articles linked by The New Observer was unclear, as the Moroccan man's August 2015 arrest appeared wholly unrelated to the September 2015 report mentioning a discovery of fake passports in Bulgaria. Moreover, Der Tagesspiegel didn't provide any links to articles or reports about a purported seizure of forged documents, and its article lacked even a date or details about the \"10,000 passports\" claim. The closest match for the claim was in an article dated 25 August 2014 (one year earlier, and not \"recently\") and published by Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency, about a seizure of a fake Syrian passports in Bulgaria: Bulgarian authorities seized thousands of fake Syrian passports in the country's second-largest city of Plovdiv, an interior ministry official said. Secretary General of the Bulgarian Interior Ministry Svetlozar Lazarov said five people including a woman were detained in connection with the operation of the illegal production of the passports. The officials found around 10,000 components for the production of the fake Syrian passports which allegedly were to be smuggled to Turkey. Lazarov also said the head of the illegal network was a forty-year old Bulgarian, but did not release the name of the ringleader. If there was a separate incident involving the seizure of 10,000 passports by Bulgarian police in 2015, none of the September 2015 articles linked to it. A search for additional sources led to an August 2014 article about the seizure of material sufficient to produce 10,000 passports in Bulgaria (not 10,000 completed passports headed to refugee camps), and that article reported that the individuals arrested in connection with that seizure were Bulgarian, not Syrian. No clear connection existed between the arrest of a Moroccan national in August 2015 and the purported passport seizure, and the conflation of the two reports seemed primarily to serve to suggest that Islamic State operatives were behind an earlier, unrelated string of arrests in connection with falsified passports.

After many viewers questioned the veracity of the claims made about Bush and his record on women's issues, the post was edited to include supporting citations for its entries; but earlier versions of the post continued to circulate without it. The numbered claims and their attendant backgrounds are as follows:", "Fact Check": "Are a social media meme's \"5 Things You Should Know About Jeb Bush\" factually accurate?", "Description": "This statement stemmed from a 2003 case involving a 22-year-old, severely developmentally disabled Florida woman who had been living in state-supervised facilities for most of her life. She had become pregnant after being raped while living in a group home and had no family to make decisions on her behalf; and (even though neither the woman herself nor anyone caring for her had sought to abort the fetus) Governor Bush stepped in and asked the court to intervene in this \"uniquely troubling situation\" and appoint a representative to protect the fetus's rights: Religious groups praised the governor's actions. \"If a guardian is appointed, there would be a clear recognition that there is a human being occupying that womb,\" said Brian Fahling, senior trial lawyer for the American Family Association's Center for Law and Policy. \"The governor has the constitutional duty to uphold the right to life.\" The Christian Coalition of Florida issued a statement in support of Mr. Bush. \"The appropriate thing to do is allow the child an opportunity at life and prosecute the criminal who raped the helpless woman.\" Critics say the governor's actions are intended to keep the issue in the courts until the woman is in the third trimester of her pregnancy and can no longer obtain an abortion. \"Our take on this is that this woman's needs, her desires and her interests need to take precedence,\" said Bebe Anderson, a lawyer with the Center for Reproductive Rights, an advocacy group. \"If she is incompetent, someone else should represent her and her interests alone and make that decision for her.\" The critics also accuse Mr. Bush, a Republican, of trying to set a precedent in establishing legal protection for fetuses and of using the case to win political points with conservative groups. The governor said in his statement, \"While others may interpret this case in light of their own positions, we see it as the singular tragedy it is, and remain focused on serving the best interests of this particular victim and her unborn child.\" The statement originated with the Florida Adoption Act of 2001 (more commonly known as \"Bill 141\" or the \"Scarlet Letter\" law), which overhauled the state's adoption regulations with the stated goal of trying to \"provide greater finality once the adoption is approved, and to avoid circumstances where future challenges to the adoption disrupt the life of the child.\" The bill was inspired, in part, by the three-year fight over Baby Emily, whose father, a convicted rapist, had contested her adoption. (The Florida Supreme Court ruled in favor of Emily's adoptive parents in 1995.) The law required that any woman who was planning to put her infant up for adoption but did not know the identity of the child's father first had to run newspaper advertisements once a week for a month in the community where the child might have been conceived disclosing their names, ages, height, hair and eye color, race and weight, the child's name and birthplace, a description of the possible father, and details of the dates and places of sexual encounters that might have produced the child. Advocates of the bill maintained that it protected the rights of men who may not have known they had fathered children and that it would \"minimize last-minute challenges from a biological father, as well as challenges a father might bring after an adoption has been made legal,\" while critics contended that it was \"draconian and humiliating,\" and that Governor Bush's failure to veto the bill indicated he supporting the \"shaming\" of women for their sexual activity. Although Jeb Bush had previously lamented the lack of social stigma for having children outside of marriage (writing in his 1995 book Profiles in Character that \"one of the reasons more young women are giving birth out of wedlock and more young men are walking away from their paternal obligations is that there is no longer a stigma attached to this behavior, no reason to feel shame\"), he did not fully approve of Bill 141 and said that the state should not be \"stigmatizing women\": Gov. Jeb Bush [has] noted numerous problems with it. Officials in the governor's office say he supports an alternative way of protecting fathers' rights one already in use in many other states. Called fathers' registries, this system permits men who believe they may have fathered a child to place their names on a confidential list, which must be checked during adoption proceedings. \"We should be making adoption easier, not more difficult, and not stigmatizing women who are trying to do the right thing,\" Bush spokeswoman Elizabeth Hirst told reporters in Tallahassee. Gov. Bush also stated in a letter to Secretary of State Katherine Harris that he felt the bill put too much responsibility on the birth mother to locate the father, and while he did not veto the \"Scarlet Letter\" bill, neither did he sign it: He passively allowed it to become law in the expectation that legislators would revise the section requiring the publication of women's sexual histories \"House Bill 141 does have its deficiencies,\" he wrote. \"Foremost, in its effort to strike the appropriate balance between rights and responsibilities, there is a shortage of responsibility on behalf of the birth father that could be corrected by requiring some proactive conduct on his part.\" In fact, immediately after he let the Florida Adoption Act become law, Bush was advocating for fixes to it. The Florida House almost immediately passed a law that Bush considered a \"better alternative.\" It cut back on women's reporting requirements and established a paternity registry, for example. These were state-maintained databases that allowed a man to register if he believed he may have fathered a child. Then, if that child were ever put up for adoption, the father would have been notified and he could have a say in the proceedings. Governor Bush repealed the \"Scarlet Letter\" law in May 2003, signing a replacement measure that instituted the paternity registry mentioned above. The repeal had become something of a moot issue by then, however, as an appeals court had ruled the previous month that it was unconstitutional for the state to require women and underage girls to disclose their sexual histories, even in cases of consensual sex. The claim that Jeb Bush hired a staffer who called women \"sluts\" is true in a literal sense, although the staffer's employment by Bush was very short-lived, as he immediately left his position after the controversy about some of his several-year-old Tweets hit the news. This brouhaha originated with Jeb Bush's temporary hiring in February 2015 of Hipster.com co-founder Ethan Czahor as his Chief Technology Officer, in charge of handling the preparations for Bush's presidential run. Almost immediately after the hiring was announced, Czahor's Twitter history was dissected and shared by various media outlets. Among their findings were a handful of tweets published by Czahor in 2009 and 2010 in which he made insensitive remarks about women and used the word \"sluts\" in reference to them. A Bush spokesman quickly characterized the comments as \"inappropriate\" and indicated that Czahor had been directed to promptly delete them. One day later, Czahor resigned from his newly-assigned position and apologized for his previous remarks. As is often the case with political memes, sometimes the basic assertions check out but are misleading or inaccurate due to a lack of context. So while it's true that Jeb Bush made a statement that resembled the one quoted above, it has been reproduced without any relevant contextual information. The controversial quote was one Bush uttered during the 1994 Florida gubernatorial campaign; and the thrust of his statement was that he favored setting a two-year limit on welfare benefits, requiring recipients after that period to find work or other assistance on their own: \"If people are mentally and physically able to work, they should be able to do so within a two-year period. They should be able to get their life together, find a husband, find a job, find other alternatives in terms of private charity or a combination of all three.\" Although a generous interpretation of this statement might be to say that Jeb Bush was simply enumerating the several possibilities that (female) welfare recipients could avail themselves of after the expiration of their benefits, he made it clear later that he felt unmarried women were a significant contribution to the welfare problem: Bush did not deny making the statement. In fact, he repeated that marriage is one way along with finding a job and help from private charities for women to get off welfare. Marriage, Bush said, \"is one of many options, and if people are honest about the welfare system we have today, how you get on welfare is not having a husband in the house.\" In support of this claim, Ultraviolet cited an April 2015 Salon article, which in turn referenced an interview Bush gave to Focus on the Family on 13 April 2015. During the course of that interview, Bush lauded Florida's role as an outlier in funding \"crisis pregnancy centers\" (CPCs) during his tenure as governor: We were the only state, I believe, to have funded with state monies crisis pregnancy centers to provide counselors so that these not-for-profits that in many cases aren't as well funded as many others, could act on their mission, which is to provide broader support, but the actual counseling was done, you know, paid for by the state. It was a godsend for these crisis pregnancy centers and a lot of babies' lives were saved and a lot of families got the joy of being able to bring a child up in their home. While Jeb Bush was governor of Florida, the state funded crisis pregnancy centers through the sales of 'Choose Life' specialty license plates (under legislation signed into law by Bush in 1999) and through the creation of the Florida Pregnancy Support Services Program (which was introduced by Bush in 2005): The Florida Pregnancy Support Services Program was introduced by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005 to increase visibility for the state's non-abortion counseling options and stem its rising abortion rate. The $4 million launch established a toll-free hotline 1-866-673-HOPE to point pregnant women in the direction of their nearest non-abortion, nonprofit option, and also provide grants to those organizations for counseling, prenatal support and adoption. The money is only available to organizations that make no mention at all of abortion. It can go to religious organizations, and it supplements the $800,000 the centers receive yearly from the state's \"Choose Life\" license plates and whatever federal funds come in. Florida was not alone in that regard, however: several other states, including Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Texas, approved state funding of crisis pregnancy centers during the same timeframe. Moreover, between 2001 and 2006 over $60 million in federal funds were given to crisis pregnancy centers, in large part through abstinence-only programs initiated during the administration of Jeb's brother, President George W. Bush.

Iterations of this rumor have circulated since at least mid-2012 (seen in a Facebook post and in the tweets embedded below); but prior to that, the rumor apparently didn't have much traction on the Internet other than a Yahoo!

A video uploaded to YouTube on 25 January 2011 depicted a young man attempting (and failing) to obtain free food at Wendy's in the manner described. The individual who narrated the video cited a friend on XBox Live as inspiration for the idea; but he didn't say whether he and his pal simply brainstormed to concoct ways to scam free food from restaurants or if they were acting on an already widespread belief that Wendy's in particular had a policy in place to feed stranded visitors: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR6F7QD-_WI This video was not YouTube's only evidence of a user attempting to hustle Wendy's for comped Frosties. Another young man tried his hand at the ruse in May 2013, claiming success in the brief clip seen below. However, it should be noted that the Wendy's employee on the other end of the drive-thru speaker simply instructed him to drive up to the window and did not definitively state that any free food was on offer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26l2KK5a7RY The claim has somewhat of a secret-handshake feel to it, perhaps in part because it's an inherently unsustainable policy for any large chain to implement. Should word get out that Wendy's staffers are obliged by the rules to feed all and sundry for free simply because they claim indigence, those in the know would soon outnumber paying customers. Ultimately, dreams of free food at Wendy's for all self-identified broke and disoriented travelers were officially dashed on 4 September 2013: https://twitter.com/wendys/status/375251775185367040 It's certainly possible that individual managers at Wendy's (or any fast food restaurant) have, on occasion, exercised discretion and supplied customers claiming to be broke and/or lost with food at no charge. However, that situation could easily occur spontaneously and irregularly at any establishment whose inventory and food cost accounting allowed for the occasional charitable freebie.

"", "Description": "THE EAN-13 barcode system is used in 85 countries, making it the most popular product scanning system of its kind in the world. It works by representing numbers as a series of seven vertical lines. Each of the seven lines is either black or white, and the sequence of lines forms a pattern which is recognized as a particular digit when scanned by a computer. Every product is assigned a unique thirteen-digit number (ten digits for the product itself, a check digit, and a couple of flag characters to indicate which organization assigned the number). Contrary to popular myth, all bar codes don't include the number 666. This belief arose because the number six is represented by a pattern similar to that of the guard bars used to mark the beginning, middle, and end of every bar code. Since the guard bars always appear three times in a given bar code, people who mistakenly read them as sixes claimed that the pattern 6-6-6 was embedded in every bar code. However, if you look closely at the '6' in a bar code, you will see that there is a wide white bar either to the left or the right of its pattern (depending upon where within the bar code the number is positioned), which is not the case with the guard bars. The only numbers on the bar code which are scanned are those shown in the conventional numerals underneath it.

vilification rumors. Most prevalent are the ones that link Coors to either Nazism or the Ku Klux Klan.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Coors has no ties to either evil entity. That part is lore, born of a need to express negative feelings about a particular business concern, put into words in the form of wildly inaccurate rumor. Two factors influence the \"Coors has a Nazi or neo-Nazi connection\": the first name of the company's founder, and the long-time association between the Coors Foundation and right-wing, conservative groups. The Adolph Coors Company was founded in 1873 by a fellow who shared a first name with the 20th century's greatest villain, Adolph Hitler. That Hitler wouldn't be fetched into the world by the stork for another sixteen years after this Colorado beer company was formed doesn't seem to affect those who search for \"meaningful\" connections to hang dark imaginings on. (Hitler was born in 1889, whereas Adolph Coors was born in 1847 and founded his company in 1873.) The second factor which is much harder to define is the association of Coors with a variety of right-wing causes and charities, and how this connection translates in some people's minds to a tie to Nazism. (Apparently to some \"right wing\" equals \"Nazi,\" and under that mode of thinking Coors' funding a conservative think tank that generated recommendations for then-President Ronald Reagan equated to arming the next generation of skinheads intent upon heading for Paris to take over the world.) The Coors family supports the Coors Foundation, which donates funds to many political, social, and educational organizations, some of which are unapologetically right-wing and conservative. These aren't monies the company puts towards these causes; the cash comes from the family , which is an important distinction. The same arguments made about Domino's Pizza owner Tom Monaghan's support of pro-life causes should be made here he was acting as a private citizen who chose to bestow a part of his fortune on the causes he believed in, not as an officer of Domino's on behalf of that corporation. The money was his to do with as he pleased, just as anyone's paycheck belongs to the person who earns it and stops being the employer's money at the moment it's paid over. The Coors Brewing Company (a principal subsidiary of the Adolph Coors Company) does indeed make contributions to a number of charities and projects, but those on its receiving end are far less controversial groups than those funded by the Coors Foundation. Beneficiaries of Coors Brewing Company's generosity include literacy and fight hunger programs. The second prevalent vilification rumor ties Coors to the Ku Klux Klan, probably as both an outgrowth of the \"right wing equals bad guy\" way of thinking and as an expression of concerns over how the company has handled race relations issues in the past. Hispanics have boycotted Coors products for decades because of claims of the company having refused to hire them. In 1969 Coors was charged with racial discrimination; it was found guilty the following year and forced to shell out thousands of dollars in back pay. The brewer has Hispanic employees and has attempted to repair this aspect of its business practices, but old wounds heal slowly, and new rumors of alleged racial insensitivities or support of controversial measures on the part of Coors fall upon receptive ears. But racial tensions don't equal white-sheeted Klansmen lurking behind every bush, which is the crux of the rumor. Coors isn't a company the Klan would want to associate with. The Coors Brewing Company has had an employment nondiscrimination policy for more than twenty years and has offered domestic partnership benefits since 1995. The brewer also has a company-recognized gay and lesbian employees group. And Scott Coors, scion of the family, is gay. None of this is to say Coors is beloved of everyone it isn't. Members of many groups feel they have legitimate grievances against either the company or the family that derives revenue from its operations and channels a portion of that income into causes close to its heart. It is this animus that provides the greatest assurance that Coors isn't allied with the KKK or Nazism if either of those two links existed, damning evidence would have long ago been paraded past the bleachers by those who have made it their business to scrutinize the company's affairs in hopes of uncovering such an association. More plainly, that rock has been turned over so many times without anything's scurrying out from under it that even the most ardent salamander enthusiast knows to look for his prey elsewhere.

The crowns swiftly became the 90s version of fuzzy dice seemingly everybody had to have them. Almost as swiftly, lore about these gewgaws sprang up as speculation over their possible meaning ran rampant.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Many people were prepared to see them as strictly prosaic items: air freshener dispensers worked into a universally pleasing shape that imbued an auto with a touch of the regal, possibly even hinting that this car's driver was truly the king of the road. But others read hidden messages into these crowns, viewing them as secret signs of membership in various communities, some not at all savory. It mattered not that some churches bought these faddish items by the case, happily latching on to the association of the symbol with Jesus (\"Christ is crowned\"), resulting in many a churchgoer's car sprouting a plastic coronet in a show of solidarity with the Savior. Most who looked for hidden meanings looked to the underworld for evilly-intentioned groups who would be using this as a shibboleth. The crowns were unspeakably gaudy affairs, molded \"metallic-look\" gold plastic accented by a variety of colors. The fresheners they contained came in seven liquid scents: vanilla, lemon, perfume, green apple, flora, strawberry, and jasmine. To release the scent, a customer opened the dome's slot by twisting the cross atop the crown. The fragrance lasted about three months. Crown air fresheners were cheap and cheap-looking. And (at least in the eyes of some) hugely favored by the African-American community. The combination of these two factors gave rise to one of the most widely-believed canards, that the company that produced these fashionable monstrosities must be owned by the Ku Klux Klan. \"Wouldn't it be just like the Klan,\" went the whisper, \"to be making their money off poor, ignorant blacks by conning them into believing there was something regal about these tacky baubles? Oh, they must be laughing up the sleeves of their white sheets, and all the way to the bank, too.\" Extensions of this rumor had a highly-placed member of the Klan appearing on a television or radio talk show to brag about how the KKK had been immensely benefited by the sale of these crowns, always ending with this spokesman thanking \"the niggers for making us rich.\" It was a blood-boiler of a legend, but the facts never supported it. The manufacturers of these crowns had no KKK ties, let alone were outright owned by them. As for the enduring myth of the Klansman's damning announcement on the talk show, that element of the tale is shared with any number of corporate legends, including the Tommy Hilfiger (\"I don't design for blacks or Asians because they make my clothes look bad\"), Liz Claiborne (\"I don't design for Black women because their hips are too big\" or \"I donate part of my profits to the Church of Satan\"), Procter & Gamble (\"We tithe to the Church of Satan\"), and Ray Kroc (\"McDonald's shares part of its profits with the Church of Satan\") slanders, to list just a few. The \"air freshener crown as a sign of gang membership\" belief was also hugely popular, once again trading on the notion that these tawdry vulgarities would appeal only to low-class Hispanics or African-Americans, this time because their desire to associate their street gang with any symbol of royalty (the better to assert the right of royal fiat over their claimed turf) would blind them to the aesthetics of these ornaments. This version of the belief was often furthered by the very names of certain gangs: it seemed only logical that the Latin Kings, for example, would adopt as its secret symbol a crown. Less widespread assertions about what those dash-mounted crowns supposedly signified included: They're a black separatist symbol. If you're white and you have one displayed in your car, you will be followed, then beaten severely and/or killed in an African-American pride version of the Lights Out! legend. African-Americans use the crowns to indicate black ownership of cars, thus guaranteeing these autos will not be molested by other blacks who might be looking for vehicles to break into, vandalize, or steal from. Just as the Israelites marked their door posts with lamb's blood to tell God to pass their households over in His visitation of death upon each home's firstborn, the crowns serve to safeguard a brother's car, even when parked in an unfamiliar neighborhood. The number of crowns signifies the car owner's standing in the drug dealing hierarchy, with more crowns indicating higher status. So much fuss over so little. The crowns signified nothing more than the owner's desire to freshen the air in his car or display what he thought a pleasing ornament. The most obvious explanation for the amount of lore that sprang up so quickly is to see it as a response to this auto accessory's overnight success one day they weren't around, and the next everybody seemed to have one. Could something that banal have been that startlingly successful all on its own, or were evil forces helping it along. (If so, whom do we blame for Pet Rocks?) The crowns are around to this day, although they're not nearly as popular as they once were. We could pat ourselves on the backs for this elevation in taste, or we could write off this outcome to a fad's time having come and (mostly) gone.

They have become very popular with the minority groups here in the area. Ex: Many Puerto-Ricans and Blacks have crowns in their cars, on the dash or rear deck. A few months ago I heard a rousing debate on our local FM Talk station about whether or not this was an example of minorities acting \"uppity\".. this was as if to say that a crown in your car made you somehow a king (don't forget this is still the deep south). Well today the plot thickened. A Black lady mentioned to me that the company that made these crowns was owned by the KKK, and its owner appeared on a national talk show and said: \"I want to thank all these niggers for making me rich!\" This incident was also reportedly reported on the local black/urban radio station who warned area Blacks to stop buying or using the crowns. [Collected on the Internet, 1995] Last Summer (white) friends of mine in both Boston and DC thought that the air freshiners in the back windows of cars were to signify that the person driving was a part of some sort of Black Islamic cult, much the way square and compass symbols signify the drivers Masonic connection. [Collected on the Internet, 1994] Last time I was in Chicago I said to a friend who lives there, \"What's the deal with those crowns, are they air fresheners?\" She looked at me as if I were crazy and said, \"They're gang symbols.\" I said, \"Maybe in Chicago they're gang symbols.

He does not go out of his way to hide his financial support of pro-life groups such as Operation Rescue and Right to Life, or right-wing fundamentalist causes such as Word of God. He was also open about his involvement with the Committee to End State-Funded Abortions in Michigan. (Not that other wealthy, powerful people don't have similar convictions or financially support controversial causes, but they are often far less public about such activities.) Is it fair to say some of the money from every pizza sold by the chain ended up in the hands of anti-abortion groups? Possibly it depends on how the matter is viewed. Certainly Domino's itself never gave money directly, and that is the persistent rumor, that the company tithed a portion of its revenues to those groups. That claim is false. Domino's used to address this rumor through the following statement found in its web site FAQ: Domino's Pizza LLC has never supported organizations on either side of the reproductive rights issue. The corporation and its 1,825 independent franchise owners across the world have one goal: to sell pizzas and grow our market share. We can't accomplish that goal if we alienate potential customers, as this issue certainly would. However, in another sense, monies from pizza sales did flow into pro-life causes via the conduit of Tom Monaghan. It needs be stressed, however, that he was acting as a private citizen who chose to bestow a part of his fortune on the causes he believed in, not as an officer of Domino's and on behalf of that corporation. The money was his to do with as he pleased, just as anyone's paycheck belongs to the person who earns it and stops being the employer's money at the moment it's paid over. That a spendthrift employee might choose to gamble away his earnings doesn't mean the company he works for supports gambling. Likewise, that a wealthy man financially supports causes others find objectionable doesn't mean the corporation that paid him the money favors those causes. Monaghan was not the only fast-food mogul to direct some of his earnings to pro-life organizations. Carl Karcher, founder of the California-based hamburger chain Carl's Jr., has been very open and public regarding his support of the pro-life philosophy. Once again though, this is a question of a well-off individual choosing to expend some of his personal riches on causes he believes in, not of the corporation he's associated with making those donations. Both Domino's and Carl's Jr. have at various times been the focus of pro-choice demonstrations and boycotts. Whatever one might think of Tom Monaghan's selection of social causes, and no matter how one views the question of direct versus indirect underwriting of them via pizza monies, it's all moot now. These days none of the revenues that flow into Domino's reach this controversial man, so no portion of what a customer pays for a medium pepperoni-and-cheese funds the causes he supports. Monaghan sold his Domino's Pizza empire to Bain Capital Inc. for $1 billion in 1998. He now runs the Ave Maria Foundation, which supports Ave Maria College, a separate law school and a system of elementary schools.

She's on everything vendible, from backpacks and coin purses to laptops and gentlemen's underwear. Her image has accompanied numerous celebrities over the years, including Carmen Electra, Cameron Diaz, Britney Spears and Sarah Jessica Parker. A line of MasterCard debit cards features a Hello Kitty design, and in November 2009 recording artist Lady Gaga dedicated an entire photo shoot to the famous little cat, appearing in a variety of outfits that sported Hello Kitty paraphernalia, including a dress made of Hello Kitty dolls.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The rumor about the little feline's being a tribute to the Devil from a grateful parent whose child was spared from the cruel and inevitable fate of a life-ending illness appears to be a backlash against all the cuteness and wholesomeness that is Hello Kitty. The rumor gained its start from a 2008 e-mail rendered in Spanish, which asserted that the frantic parents of a 12-year-old girl stricken with cancer of the mouth made a pact with the Devil to bring to worldwide fame a character alluring to children in exchange for their daughter's return to health. The fatuous account asserts \"kitty\" is a Chinese word meaning \"demon,\" thus Hello Kitty means \"hello demon\" that is, those who fall for the character's charms are welcoming the Devil and all his minions into their hearts. However, Hello Kitty is Japanese, not Chinese, in origin, and we're wholly unaware of any Chinese language (there are many) wherein \"kitty\" means \"demon.\" The e-mail also asserts that Hello Kitty's lack of a mouth stems from that fictitious 12-year-old's illness; the girl had cancer of the mouth, so the character created to spare her life lacks that feature. That tidbit of information is also claptrap: the sweet-faced little cat was created in 1974 by Sanrio, a Japanese company that designs and licenses branded characters, and she first appeared on a coin purse. The astonishing success of Hello Kitty can be attributed to Japan's kawaii aesthetic that worships all things cute, lovable, and adorable. The second Hello Kitty origin myth (i.e., that the character was invented to help win public acceptance of a controversial nuclear power plant in Japan) echoes a rumor that Cabbage Patch dolls were given their characteristic appearance in an effort to accustom people to the look of mutants following a nuclear war. As is the case with the \"tribute to the Devil\" rumor, it too is nonsense. Sanrio's web site says that Hello Kitty lacks a mouth because \"Hello Kitty speaks from her heart. She's Sanrio's ambassador to the world and isn't bound to any particular language.\" Yo Kato, producer of the 30th anniversary Kitty Exhibition in Tokyo said in 2004, \"She has no mouth and no expression, which enables people to assign their own interpretation be it as a cute item or as something cool.\" And Sanrio spokesman Kazuhide Yoneyama said in 1999, \"Without the mouth, it is easier for the person looking at Hello Kitty to project their feelings on to the character. The person can be happy or sad together with Hello Kitty.\" Barbara \"unCheshire'd cat\" Mikkelson Additional information: Sanrio web site", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.sanrio.com/;http://www.sanrio.com/faq/faq#27;http://www.ladygaga.com/photos/detail.aspx?fid=15816&in=3;", "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, July 2010] The story is how Hello Kitty came to be...that a mother or father, depending on the version of the story had a child that had cancer. The parent made a pact with the devil that if the child was cured they would create a character in the devil's honor that would be adored worldwide. There are different variations but they all boil down to the point that Hello Kitty is evil and that God fearing people should stay away from any HK products as they are affiliated with the devil and devil worship. [Collected via e-mail, March 2005] I've heard from a couple people that Hello Kitty, the famous flagship mascot of Japanese mascot design house Sanrio actually got her start as the mascot for a controversial nuclear power plant in Japan in the early 70s? Seems that, given Japan's past with all things nuclear, the Japanese were understandably quite loath to having a nuclear power plant opening on their soil. So, the story goes, they hired Sanrio to create a people-friendly mascot that they could use to brand all their official stationery, literature, advertisements, products, etc. That mascot was, of course, Hello Kitty, who became so popular with the Japanese general public that she (and Sanrio) took on a life of her own and eventually everyone forgot about her power plant past and became the icon that she is today.", "Last Updated": "22 June 2015", "Credibility": "false", "URL": "www.snopes.com/business/alliance/hellokitty.asp", "Claim": "A pact with the Devil to save a cancer-stricken child resulted in the creation of the Hello Kitty brand.", "Claim_ID": "business_alliance_hellokitty", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/business/alliance/hellokitty.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "reason.com", "link": "http://reason.com/blog/2010/09/01/the-devil-went-down-to-tokyo", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "yoururbanlegend.blogspot.com", "link": "http://yoururbanlegend.blogspot.com/2014/01/hello-kitty-good-bye-soul.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "mp3x.us", "link": "http://mp3x.us/search/?q=Hello+Kitty+%3A+snopes.com", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "search.aibing.cc", "link": "http://search.aibing.cc/Is+hello+kitty+from+the+devil.shtml", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "", "link": "/interstitial?url=http://search.lycos.com.au/web%3Fq%3Dhello%2Bkitty%2Borigin%2Bstory%26keyvol%3D00cd6b92b021cec6b012", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "healthtipstoday.science", "link": "http://healthtipstoday.science/hello-kitty-devil", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.chacha.com", "link": "http://www.chacha.com/question/what-is-the-hello-kitty-legend%26%2347%3Burban-myth", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.car2future.info", "link": "http://www.car2future.info/hello-kitty-devil", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "hardtacktink.fr.gd", "link": "http://hardtacktink.fr.gd/create-a-hello-kitty-email.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "townscountytourism.com", "link": "http://townscountytourism.com/hello-kitty-devil", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.weidaohang.org", "link": "http://www.weidaohang.org/wangluo/Hello+Kitty+Meaning+Devil.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "m.xilun.com", "link": "http://m.xilun.com/?q=hello+kitty&p=10", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.uttaradeal.in", "link": "http://www.uttaradeal.in/index.php?page=search/web&search=mean+hello+kitty&type=web", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.sandiegoinsider.com", "link": "http://www.sandiegoinsider.com/search/residential/core/6554926838245150131/external.cox?crumbs=~%2Fresidential%2Fexternal&term=SGVsbG8gS2l0dHk&encoded=true&start=20", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.baidu.com.se", "link": "http://www.baidu.com.se/?q=hello+kitty&p=9", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.dafcom.net", "link": "http://www.dafcom.net/article/Hello%20Devil", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "awipuzin.boxhost.me", "link": "http://awipuzin.boxhost.me/qisezez.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "oyusywuv.site.bz", "link": "http://oyusywuv.site.bz/cibesew.html", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "semabypi.moxo.cz", "link": "http://semabypi.moxo.cz/celebazob.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "yxemygojeh.uhostfull.com", "link": "http://yxemygojeh.uhostfull.com/xefira.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "vucekok.uhostall.com", "link": "http://vucekok.uhostall.com/zoxapap.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "so.zanhuangwang.com", "link": "http://so.zanhuangwang.com/?q=hello+kitty&p=10", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "ecerohovih.moxo.sk", "link": "http://ecerohovih.moxo.sk/hywixiced.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "", "link": "/interstitial?url=http://www.kuaiso.hk/%3Fq%3Dhellokitty%26p%3D10", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.thecoolhunter.net", "link": "http://www.thecoolhunter.net/cloud/view/Vilnius", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.marten.cc", "link": "http://www.marten.cc/news-archive1.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "999kaopu.com", "link": "http://999kaopu.com/?q=hallo+kety&p=2", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "tommctighe.com", "link": "http://tommctighe.com/test/word-test-25k-scrubbed.html", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "In 1670, Charles II of England granted a Royal Charter to Prince Rupert and seventeen associates (known collectively as \"The Company of Adventurers\") giving them the rights to \"sole trade and commerce\" within the entrance of Hudson Strait in North America. This charter effectively established the Hudson's Bay Company and gave them control over all lands whose rivers and streams drained into Hudson Bay, an enormous area designated \"Rupert's Land,\" which encompassed most of Northern Ontario and Northern Quebec, all of Manitoba, most of Saskatchewan, the southern half of Alberta, a large part of the Northwest Territories, and much of what is now the U.S. states of Minnesota and North Dakota altogether about 40% of modern day Canada.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "As described in The Hudson's Bay Company archives : What began as a simple fur-trading enterprise evolved into a trading and exploration company that reached to the west coast of Canada and the United States, south to Oregon, north to the Arctic and east to Ungava Bay, with agents in Chile, Hawaii, California, and Siberia; a land development company with vast holdings in the prairie provinces; a merchandising, natural resources and real estate development company and, today, Canada's oldest corporation and one of its largest retailers. The days of trapping furs and trading with Native Americans in British North America are long gone, and today the Hudson's Bay Company is known primarily as Canada's largest chain of retail department stores . But our fascination with anachronistic laws and customs that remain on the books and must be observed even though the practical reasons for their implementation have long since been rendered obsolete preserves the Hudson's Bay Company's centuries-old fur-trader image in a legend: The original Royal Charter granted by King Charles II in 1670 requires the Hudson's Bay Company to make a traditional payment of elk and beaver pelts to England's reigning monarch, so every year the company dutifully sends a gift of a few animal skins to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II . Actually, the Hudson's Bay Company's original charter did call for it to provide two elk heads and two beaver pelts to royalty, but only when said royalty came to the Rupert's Land area of Canada, not as an annual payment. This \"tradition\" has been observed on three occasions when royalty traveled to Canada, all of them in the twentieth century: a visit by King George VI in 1939, and visits by Queen Elizabeth II in 1959 and 1970.

These tiny notations are placed in out-of-the-way spots (the undersides of cups and near the seams of the paper pouches burgers are placed in). No overt explanation is given for the presence of the odd phrases or their meaning: they just quietly sit there, awaiting decipherment by those moved to do so.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "These mysterious markings are pointers to Biblical passages. Those easily disturbed by the presence of Bible verses need not fear for their souls, however: The text of the passages themselves are not spelled out on the cups and wrappings; only their notations appear there. In-N-Out Burger was founded by Harry and Esther Snyder in Baldwin Park, California, in 1948. Although this chain of west coast hamburger restaurants has since grown to more than 200 outlets, control still rests in the hands of the Snyder family. According to the company's web site: \"In-N-Out remains privately owned and the Snyder family has no plans to take the company public or franchise any units.\" The Snyders are a religious family, and their continuing to control their own company means they can put what they want on their product packaging. They've chosen to include pointers to particular Bible verses that we presume hold special meaning for them. The soda cup bears the notation John 3:16: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. The milkshake cup lists Proverbs 3:5: Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. The water cup (no longer available to customers but we're told still used by employees) bears John 14:6: Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. The hamburger and cheeseburger wrappers point to Revelation 3:20: Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. The wrap used for the \"Double-Double\" (two burger patties and two slices of cheese) lists Nahum 1:7: The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. The French fry holder lists Proverbs 24:16: For though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again, but the wicked are brought down by calamity. We examined the packaging of other menu offerings from In-N-Out (coffee cups, milk containers) but failed to uncover any further pointers to Bible verses. The ones we've found expound upon a shared theme: belief in the Lord. As proselytizing goes, this is about as low-key as it gets. Not even the texts of the verses themselves are printed out; those looking to absorb the messages (and who don't have this article handy) have to do so with the assistance of their own Bibles. Yet even so, the presence of those simple notations has been interpreted by some as indicative of a lurking menace: we've had folks tell us they've heard In-N-Out Burger was \"owned by the religious right\" or \"the Christian Coalition,\" or a \"sect,\" or that bible-study classes were secretly held at each location. Likewise, the search for a good backstory to enliven whatever appears even slightly mysterious has given birth to a rumor that the presence of the Bible verses is in some way connected to the 1993 death of son Richard Snyder (41) in a plane crash. Though even In-N-Out Burger can't provide a precise date of when the Bible citations were first placed on its packaging, company records indicate they've been there at least since 1987, which rules out the \"deceased son\" theory.

indicating Ku Klux Klan ownership have been in circulation at least since the mid-1980s. By 1989 these slanders had become so widespread that they were well known even in France and England.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Which markings indicates Klan ownership vary, depending upon whom you hear the rumor from: The red chevroning on the white background is often cited is as forming the two jutting arms of the capital letter \"K\" when the pack is tipped on its side. Given that the chevroning appears on three surfaces of the pack (front and back plus one of the sides the one carrying the Surgeon General's warning has no room for additional styling), one could \"read\" three Ks on the pack, resulting in \"KKK\", the abbreviated name of the Ku Klux Klan. The two horses on the Marlboro crest also come in for comment. When viewed upside-down, the positioning of their forelegs could be taken for a hand gesture known in the United States as the \"V for Victory\" or \"Peace\" symbol (depending on which generation one hails from). This \"victory\" symbol is read by those looking for proof of Klan involvement as a symbol of Klan triumph. (Be careful with flashing that gesture abroad in England, delivering it with the palm faced inwards towards the signaler's body means \"Up Yours!\") Some who look between the horses legs see two hooded Klansmen carrying the motto banner. The \"Veni, Vidi, Vici\" motto emblazoned on the banner is believed by some to be the motto of the Ku Klux Klan. (Evidently, they'd never heard of Julius Caesar.) The final five letters of Marlboro are \"lboro.\" Reverse them to get \"orobl,\" a fragment conspiracy theorists claim is meant to be read as \"horrible.\" Turning \"Marlboro\" upside-down and reading the first three letters backwards results in \"jeW\" (the upside-down \"r\" looks like a \"j\"). All together, this decoding results in \"horrible jew.\" (Why, precisely, the phrase \"horrible jew\" is supposed to indicate ties to the KKK as opposed to general anti-semitism is never explained.) Tearing open the bottom of the pack in a certain way was rumored to reveal the head of a hooded Klansman, with two spots (one black, one gold) on the package serving as the Klansman's eyes. (The two spots were actually common printers' proofs for colors used on packaging. They don't appear on current packs, however, as Philip Morris has done away with them.) Marlboro is the flagship tobacco product of the Philip Morris Company. There is no evidence that PMC is or was ever owned by the Ku Klux Klan, even back in its early days when it was still possible for individuals to own enough of the company to have any sort of a say in how it was run. PMC has no need to fear doing its laundry in public, sheets and all. One has to wonder at the basic premise of the whisper. Even if the KKK did own a business (and in the world of specious rumor the list of companies it's supposed to control is endless), why would it be fool enough to advertise the fact, even by way of coded references worked into package design? A huge public backlash would be risked against no potential gain, and that makes no sense. Were such ownership to come to light, whatever firm the KKK ran would be immediately boycotted, lose its customer base in the blink of an eye, and have to shut its door forever shortly thereafter. If there's one sure death knell a company could sound, it would be to announce it's owned by the Ku Klux Klan. Okay, so the rumor fails the common sense test. Why is it so popular, then? Everyone likes to think he's been let in on a secret, and that is perhaps what lies at the heart of this bit of lore. That the rumor itself is ridiculous doesn't interfere with that special frisson of knowing something others have yet to catch on to. Besides, everyone knows cigarettes are bad for you and the companies who profit from flogging them are evil why not combine both elements with the KKK, one of the few groups in existence worthy of being paired off with them? According to lore, PMC's founder, Philip Morris, was a Klan member, which is supposedly how Marlboro fell into the hands of the KKK. Truth is, Morris was a London tobacco shop owner in the 1850s. In 1902 this British manufacturer set up a corporation in New York to sell its British brands, including Philip Morris, Blues, Cambridge, Derby, and one named after the street its London factory was on, Marlborough. (Heh. So much for that \"orobl jew\" theory.) (A similar KKK rumor circulates about Richard Joshua Reynolds, founder of Reynolds Tobacco, the firm which produces Camels. That too is untrue, although Reynolds was a native of Virginia, which at least would make a bit more sense than trying to pin KKK membership on a London shop owner. Strangely enough, most of the lore surrounding Camels has to do with naked men and phalluses hidden in the artwork.) Let's look at why it's impossible for the KKK to own Marlboro. The Philip Morris Company was incorporated in New York shortly after the turn of the century. These days it is publicly owned and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol MO. The claim that any one entity could own this company is laughable there are 2.4 billion shares of MO on the market. At a November 1998 peak of $58.25 per share, that's $139.8 billion. Even at the November 1999 low of $24.75 per share, just a 1% holding of the Philip Morris Company would amount to $600 million, placing even this tiny slice of the pie far beyond the means of most well-organized, strongly-financed investor groups, let alone a white supremacist group forced by its very nature to operate in a surreptitious fashion. (It's not like the KKK has corporate headquarters, openly collects dues, or flaunts letterhead and checkbook emblazoned \"Ku Klux Klan.\") It's inevitable that a firm as large as the Philip Morris Company would become the target for wild rumors. Even if cigarette companies enjoyed a positive image in the marketplace, they would still provoke jealousy simply because of their size and the ubiquity of their product. That they're despised both for what cigarettes do and for their conduct in keeping vital information from the public as long as they did only paints a brighter bullseye on their backsides. But that bullseye would always have been there anyway. Earlier in this article we mentioned how one set of printers' marks has been mistaken in the world of lore for the eyes of a lurking Klansman. Another printing rumor exists about a set of marks located under the bottom flap of the box. Alpha-numeric renderings such as \"Wn-2\" have been interpreted by some as proof of a secret promotion being run by the company which entitles the finder to free product, either one or two packs, depending on the numeral in the string. Another version states the valuable hidden marks are located on the cigarettes themselves, underneath the paper just above the filter, and that an all-letter or all-number find entitles the lucky paper-peeler to a free carton of cigs. This tale is only wishful thinking. Though Marlboro has run a number of promotions requiring the accumulation of tokens found on its cigarette packs to later be exchanged for premiums (merchandise), it has yet to run a secret promotion, nor is it ever likely to. The object, after all, of such giveaways is to attract new customers with the whiff of \"something for nothing\" while maintaining established custom by building brand loyalty. Such an agenda is not served by failing to advertise what goodies are up for grabs or how to get your paws on them. Not all lore associated with Marlboro cigarettes is false, however. At least one actor who portrayed the Marlboro man in the product's advertising did die of lung cancer.

However, in the realm of the rumor, menthols are especially excoriated, with a number of unusual slanders attached particularly to them, extra to the usual industry-wide KKK ownership rumors.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "What is there about menthols that so attracts the gossipmongers? Perhaps it's that we're unusually suspicious about products we know to be additive-laden. The more nervous among us would therefore focus on menthols because even the uninitiated can taste the mint in them and have sufficient awareness to conclude that natural tobacco doesn't pick up a flavor like that all on its own. Something got put in there. And (at least in the realm of rumor) whatever got put in there has to be pure evil. The idea that menthols must be especially terrible for the smoker because things are tossed into them that aren't added to regular cigarettes is terribly naive. All cigarettes contain additives, else they couldn't be smoked. In addition to menthol in mentholated products, humectants (applied for the purpose of moisture retention) and preservatives are necessary. American cigarettes in particular are wildly additive-laden, with more than 600 chemicals and flavorants used in them. (Canadian cigarettes, by contrast, are almost entirely pure tobacco, except for what's required to help them burn evenly.) Rumors about menthol cigarettes tend to fall into two categories: those having to do with specific brands, and those having to do with the product in general. Dealing first with specific brands, a common rumor about Kool is that it's owned by the KKK. Both Reynolds Tobacco ( Camels ) and Philip Morris ( Marlboro ) have seen the same rumors applied to them. None of these companies has ties to the KKK, but claims that they do continue to fall on receptive ears. In Kool's case, that brand's choice of initial letter has bolstered speculation about a possible Ku Klux Klan tie in the same way the red chevrons on the Marlboro pack have affected perception of ownership of that product. Tobacco has always been linked to the oppression of African-Americans. This association started with the importation of slaves into the United States to serve in the tobacco fields. The connection between tobacco and harm to the black man may be old but it still exerts power today. This theme constantly turns up in lore about cigarettes, often expressed in the form of rumors about a white supremacist group secretly controlling a lucrative cigarette company and thus enriching itself by dealing in the traditional bane of the African-American. Getting away from brand-specific slanders and shifting to general menthol rumors, among the black community it's widely believed menthol cigarettes pose an especial threat to African-Americans. According to baseless rumor, companies marketing menthol cigarettes have been increasing the amount of menthol in the formula to accelerate the formation of lung cancer in black smokers or to cause smokers' lungs to bleed. African-American smokers gravitate towards menthols that bit of news consistently turns up through study after study. This fact certainly lies at the heart of numerous rumors of harmful substances being mixed into these products with a view towards either killing off black consumers (cancer, bleeding lungs) or impeding the growth of the black population (impotence, sterility). What this form of rumor justification fails to take into account is that while menthol smokers form the majority among African-American smokers (75%), across the wider market of the U.S. as a whole, blacks comprise the minority of menthol cigarette smokers (25%). Significantly more non-blacks than blacks indulge in menthols, thus any insidious plot to harm African-Americans through their minty cigarettes is going to adversely effect a far greater number of whites. One of the \"blacks are being targeted\" rumors gives voice to fears that something heinous is added to menthol cigarettes to increase the possibility of lung cancer. A so-far unsuccessful lawsuit brought against the tobacco industry in 1999 suggested that menthol compounds, when burned, create toxic substances that make such cigarettes more dangerous than others. The plaintiffs have so far failed to establish this point, although government studies concede that the more soothing flavor of menthols might induce smokers to inhale more deeply, thus leading to a higher cancer rate among menthol smokers. If baseless scares about menthol cigarettes stayed focused on KKK ownership or specific danger to African Americans, they'd be understandable. (Just about every cigarette is rumored to have KKK ties, and the high proportion of African-American menthol smokers would fuel the other.) But the menthol carousel doesn't stop turning there other rumors are afoot which have nothing to do with the KKK or an underhanded plot to cut a swathe through the African-American community. Menthols are rumored to contain fiberglass. According to this canard, the evil cigarette companies secrete the substance in the product in an effort to better transmit that menthol sensation and nicotine kick by way of causing tiny cuts in the smoker's throat and mouth. This same rumor also attaches to smokeless (chewing) tobacco, especially to the Kodiak brand. There's no fiberglass in cigarettes. Granted, RJR did try using a fiberglass shell on its flopped smokeless cigarettes in 1994, but that part of the contraption wasn't ingested by the smoker; it was more of a housing, if you will. Other than that, no fiberglass. The fiberglass rumor parallels similar falsities about Carmex lip balm and tampons . But of course if consumers overuse lip balm, they will come to rely on it and afterwards have to continue using the product. That little detail of life isn't in dispute, but rather than accept it, some Carmex users prefer to believe the evil manufacturer secretes ground glass in the product to roughen users' lips and thus enslave them to the little jars with the yellow lids. Likewise, a cyber-rumor that swept the Internet in 1999 claimed evil tampon manufacturers were putting asbestos in that product to promote bleeding and thus ensure women went through more tampons per period. The common sense realization that if the government had deemed asbestos far too dangerous to have in the walls of homes, it certainly wouldn't passively watch from the sidelines as consumers stuck the same substance inside themselves failed to occur to as many people as one would hope, and this rumor about asbestos flew from one inbox to another. We've saved the best for last on this list of menthol rumors. A surprising number of young men cannot be persuaded by any means short of a bikini-clad redhead to smoke a menthol. According to what they've heard, menthol cigs will render them impotent. They base that mistaken belief on another rumor, that saltpeter is used in the product to aid in keeping the cigs lit. (It isn't.) Similarly, in the 1960s, Thailand experienced a run on a related rumor, that smoking menthols would shrink a fella's winky. Sales of menthols plummeted there in the wake of that whisper making the rounds. (90% of smokers in Thailand are male, and it looks like they were determined to keep it that way.) There's no reason to fear coming down with a shriveled willy after a wild night of mentholation. Like the rumor about Mountain Dew , this one has nothing to it. There is, however, a tenuous connection between male impotence and smoking in general. For decades, doctors have believed smoking can harm a man's sexual function because it constricts blood vessels, compromising blood flow. Over the years, studies have strengthened those beliefs, most recently in 1994, when a study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology surveyed Vietnam veterans and found that while 2.2% of nonsmokers suffered persistent impotence, 3.7% of current smokers did. Many researchers also believe smoking may lower sperm count. So what's the bottom line of all this? Menthol cigarettes are no worse for your sperm than any other type. Mind you, that's not exactly heartening news.

This is something that should be kept in mind when examining the plausibility of wild tales about damning admissions supposedly made by corporate types on popular talk shows.) How Procter & Gamble directs its profits is a matter of public record, as it is for all publicly-traded companies. (Procter & Gamble is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PG .) Were P&G handing a \"large portion\" of its profits to Satan, that would be readily apparent in the company's financial statements. Those who accepted the rumor as revealed truth pointed to P&G's \"man in the moon\" logo as proof of the company's ties to evil. They saw in the curlicues of the moon man's hair and beard a pair of devil' horns and an array of 6s, and they believed that by playing \"connect the dots\" with the thirteen stars in the logo, three 6s could be made to appear.

There is nothing sinister in the logo's design, let alone a hidden code that reveals the true intent of the company. P&G's \"man in the moon\" trademark was adopted in 1851, at a time when goods were more commonly marked with visual trademarks than with companies' names. The ability to read was not as widespread then as it is now, so companies offering an array of consumer goods rather than just one product had strong reason to devise memorable pictorial logos for their wares. The thirteen stars were an homage to the original thirteen colonies of the United States of America, and the man in the moon was simply a popular decorative device of the times. (Specific visual motifs often enjoy periods of enthusiastic commercial use and then sink into cultural obscurity. America in the early part of the 20th century was Egypt crazy, but few commercial designs other than the Camels cigarette pack remain to remind us of that fact.) Nonetheless, in the face of persistent \"Satanism\" rumors, Procter & Gamble modified their logo in 1991 to eliminate the supposed horns and 6's, and in 1995 they dropped the \"man in the moon\" logo entirely in favor of a simple stylized \" P&G \" rendered in blue letters. In July 1999 the dog and pony were trotted into the ring once again, with the claim about a CEO's admission that his company was donating a portion of their profits to the Church of Satan being amended to reference an incident that supposedly place on 1 March 1998 on the Sally Jesse Raphael Show . What makes this particular claim refutable is the date: 1 March 1998 was a Sunday, and the Sally Jesse Raphael Show show neither tapes nor airs on that day of the week. After this error was pointed out, whoever \"fixes\" these things altered the Sally Jesse version to change the day of the interview to 19 July 1999, a Monday. Same slander, just a different date. And still as specious as ever. In response to all the inquiries about this claim, Sally Jesse Raphael added the following disclaimer to her FAQ : Sally listens: Rumor has it that the president of Procter and Gamble appeared on your show and said that he was associated with the Church of Satan. I would appreciate more information if you have any, perhaps a tape of the show if available. If this is a hoax, please let me know. Sally Sez: The rumor going around that the president of Procter and Gamble appeared on The Sally Show and announced he was a member of the church of Satan is not true. This a hoax that's been going around in one form or another for the past 20 years... only originally, it concerned the Phil Donahue Show...then evolved to the Jenny Jones Show ... and now it's evolved to The Sally Show. The president of Procter and Gamble has NEVER appeared on The Sally Show...NEVER. Nor has any other person in authority at P&G. Any president of a multi-national corporation (including the head of P&G or Liz Claiborne) would be immediately fired by the board of directors if he or she did such a thing. Also, profits from any such corporation go to the stockholders ... not a church designated by the president. Do not send money in to get a transcript. We do not provide transcripts or video tapes of our shows to the public. Frankly, this thing has gotten out of hand. If we had this man on our show, and he had said what it's alleged he said, we would have scored a broadcasting scoop and would have trumpeted it to all the newspapers. It would have been to the show's advantage. But there was no scoop, and there were no headlines. The e-mail's comment about \"not enough Christians to make a difference\" is meant to inflame readers to the point of boycotting P&G products. Of course that statement angrys up the blood; that is its purpose. The statement is also woefully in error: three out of four adult Americans identify themselves as Christian, and adult Americans are the target consumer group for P&G. The rumor is framed in such a way as to offend three-quarters of P&G's buying public and influence them into shunning P&G products in protest. Those whose first instinct is to react angrily to the \"not enough Christians\" comment should instead pause to reflect that their chains are deliberately being yanked by those who would prefer (for their own reasons) that people not buy from Procter and Gamble. Although the origin of the P&G satanism rumor is unknown, Procter & Gamble has over the years initiated a number of lawsuits against Amway Corp. (now known as Alticor), a vendor of household products (many of which compete with Procter & Gamble's brands), charging it with fomenting the slander. P&G claimed distributors for Amway revived the rumors in 1995 when one of them recounted a version of the TV show rumor on the Amway distributors' national voice mail system, and in March 2007 a jury awarded P&G $19.25 million after finding that four Amway distributors had spread false rumors about P&G to advance their own business. The self-same \"head of large company proclaims that company tithes Satanic causes\" hoax has been kited about others. In 1990, designer Liz Claiborne was dogged by the widely-believed rumor that during a recent appearance on Oprah she admitted to donating 40% of the profits from her clothing company to support the Church of Satan. The rumor was wholly false (Liz Claiborne never even appeared on that Oprah's show), but that didn't stop the tale from spreading. Similarly, in 1977 the rumor mill had it that Ray Kroc of McDonald's also made the startling admission on a TV talk show that his company tithed the Church of Satan. Again, even though there was nothing to this bit of gossip, it was believed and acted upon not only did customers boycott the golden arches, but kids quit their McDonald's-sponsored Little League teams over the slander.

Such rumors have dogged, at one time or another, Ray Kroc of McDonald's, Carl Karcher of Carl's Jr., Dave Thomas of Wendy's, and Harland Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Why this class of legend has been so assiduously linked to the fast food industry is something we haven't yet fathomed: fast food founders don't seem to be, as a group, of any particular religious, geographic, or political affiliation. And the specific linking of Kentucky Fried Chicken's founder, Harland Sanders, with the Ku Klux Klan doesn't seem to have any basis in fact, other than a vague, naive assumption that a businessman who epitomized the popular image of a 19th century Southern gentleman a distinguished, elderly man with white hair, moustache, and goatee who wore white suits and black ties, posed with a cane, and affected the honorary title of \"Colonel\" must be a Klan sympathizer. What rumors such as the claim that \"Colonel Sanders' will devotes 10% of KFC's yearly profits to the Ku Klux Klan\" reflect is the misperception that Harland David Sanders owned KFC until the day he died. In fact, Sanders sold his interest in Kentucky Fried Chicken long before his death, agreeing in 1964 to a $2 million buyout of his U.S. operations by a group of investors (who took the company public a few years later) and turning his entire holdings in the company's Canadian franchises over to charity in 1965, so even if Sanders' will had contained a \"KKK donation\" bequest (which it didn't), it wouldn't have been legally enforceable. Sanders did continue to serve as KFC's spokesperson and appear in their advertising for many years after the 1964 sale, a participation that undoubtedly led many consumers to believe that he was active in the chain's ownership and management until he finally passed away in 1980. Ditto for the claim that Kentucky Fried Chicken was legally required to provide free meals to the homeless until it cleverly ducked the responsibility by changing its name to \"KFC.\" Although Sanders did give away a good deal of money during his lifetime and may occasionally have taken pity on some down-and-out types and offered them food at no charge, he neither left any mandate obligating the Kentucky Fried Chicken company to engage in the practice nor had any standing to do so. And, in any case, the company couldn't have evaded that imperative simply by changing its name. (Imagine what a shambles the business world would be if people and businesses could discharge debts and other legal obligations merely by filing some change of name documents!) As we document in another KFC-related article , Kentucky Fried Chicken changed its corporate name to KFC in 1991 for several reasons, foremost among them that increasingly health-conscious consumers were becoming wary of foods advertised as \"fried.\" Upon his death in 1980, Harland Sanders left behind an estate that was smaller than expected and a will that contained no unusual provisions: The late Col. Harland Sanders, the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken who donated millions to charity, left an estate of less than $1.5 million, according to his will. Most of the estate will go into a trust, with Citizens Fidelity Bank and Trust Co. as executor and trustee, according to documents filed in Shelby County District Court. Sanders, who died Dec. 16 [1980] at 90, made four individual bequests in addition to the money he put in trust, [Kentucky Fried Chicken spokesman John] Cox said. He left a watch to one grandson and a Masonic ring to another grandson. He left $2,000 to Louis Broadus of Richmond, Ky., a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise holder and friend, Cox said, and $5,000 to Harland Williams of Nashville, the son of a longtime friend. Cox said Sanders' estate may be far less than $1.5 million, since $1,187,557 is an estimate of \"property of unknown value\" such as notes and accounts receivable.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=;", "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, 2000] I heard today that Colonel Sanders' will devotes 10% of KFC's yearly profits to the Ku Klux Klan.

Another specious whisper intoned that it supported Operation Rescue , a pro-life group. By year-end, a third was making the rounds, that the company brewed some of its teas in then-apartheid South Africa.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "These rumors were damaging, and the company initially tried to deal with them in a quiet, one-on-one fashion. It trod softly on publicity but firmly on inquiries, not saying anything in public, but writing back to everyone who dropped Snapple a line about what they'd heard. \"The rumors are so ridiculous we thought they would go away, but they didn't,\" said Leonard Marsh, then president of the firm. \"It reached the point it was getting out of hand and we had to address it.\" In 1993 Snapple Beverage Co. went toe to toe with the slanders. Full-page ads appeared in major northern California newspapers, denying the claim that the company was allied with either the Ku Klux Klan or Operation Rescue. \"We are not involved in any way whatsoever with the KKK, Operation Rescue or any other type of pressure group or organization, period,\" said the ad. The claims about South Africa (a far less widespread rumor and one that only followed months later on the heels of the other two) were not publicly addressed, but they too were false. Snapple's three co-founders, Hyman Golden, Leonard Marsh, and Arnold Greenberg, were interviewed on MTV. \"How could three Jewish boys from Brooklyn support the Ku Klux Klan?\" they said. As for the right-to-life rumor, they aptly pointed out that supporting a cause which is controversial is guaranteed to be bad for business. The KKK rumor was putatively supported by two aspects of the beverage's former label's design: the ship that used to be portrayed in the background and the small letter K off to the side. Those who choose to see conspiracies lurking everywhere claimed the vessel as a 'blackbirder,' a slave ship that brought enslaved blacks to America. Look at the label closely, they would say, and you'll see captured blacks in chains on the deck and crewmen further in the background wearing the distinctive Klansman sheet-and-hood get-ups. It's amazing how imagination can prompt folks to see things that are not there. The photo used for the label came from the Bettmann Archive and was a drawing of the Boston Tea Party. As for the K (another sign rumored to point to a Klan connection), it's a standard symbol found on many foodstuffs that signifies that particular product meets Kosher dietary standards. In response to the slander, Snapple redesigned its iced tea labels to add the words \"Boston Tea Party\" to explain the subject of the illustration. The encircled K was enhanced with the words \"kosher pareve\" to clarify what that symbol stood for. A still later redesign dropped the ship entirely. The company never did discover who began the rumors or why. It's possible the uproar was in part fueled by Snapple's then decision to advertise around arch-conservative radio and TV personality Rush Limbaugh's radio show. (That association ended in 1994.)

Even a lot of the things on lists of Amazing Facts aren't really \"facts\" because they're wrong it's like somebody just makes this stuff up or something.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Heinz , of course, is a real company, a Pittsburgh-based concern started in 1869 by Henry J. Heinz and L. Clarence Noble as a purveyor of horseradish; later famed for its ketchup, pickles, and \"57 Varieties\" slogan. And Alphabetti Spaghetti is indeed a real Heinz product, a foodstuff that has been described as \"overcooked tinned pasta in tomato sauce shaped like letters of the alphabet.\" Were Nazi-era Germans really so enamored of their national swastika symbols that they really wanted to eat them? Even if they did, many American companies had stopped supplying product to Germany by the outbreak of World War II in 1939, many more ceased operations in Germany (either by choice or because the European markets had become inaccessible) after the war was underway, and nearly all of the remainder were out of the German market soon after America entered the war at the end of 1941. That an American company (especially one without a subsidiary in Germany or some other Axis-controlled country) would have been doing business in Germany all the way from 1937 through 1945 would have been quite remarkable. (Ford, in particular, has come under criticism in recent years because its German subsidiary used slave labor to produce automobiles during World War II ; its defenders have maintained that \"Ford Company in America had lost control of Ford in Germany during the war\" and therefore did not condone or profit from its activities.) In any case, the \"pasta swastikas\" appear to be a heretofore unknown foodstuff, mention of which first appeared on an Internet list of spurious \"facts\" in 2001. Reference works on food, consumer products, World War II , and the Heinz company turned up no information about it, leaving us to turn to Heinz itself for a definitive answer. Their initial response was less than reassuring: This is in reference to your inquiry regarding the production a swastika-shaped pasta that the H.J. Heinz Company allegedly produced during W.W. II. We are currently researching the issue to verify that we never made such a pasta shape. I will write back to you as soon as I get the \"official\" word from our Archivist. Usually a response such as this one should be interpreted as public relations-speak for \"Denying this would be a lie, so we're just going to cover ourselves by claiming we can't confirm it. Now go away and stop bothering us.\" However, Heinz did take the time to research the issue and follow up with additional information several days later: This is in response to your inquiry regarding the recent internet rumor associated with the H.J. HeinzCompany. According to the Heinz archivist, the H.J. Heinz Company did not produce pasta, in any shape, for the German market during World War II. The Heinz Company was a major contributor to the Allies' war efforts, producing K and C Rations. Additionally, a portion of the Pittsburgh plant was used as a secret production facility to produce airplane glider wings. The wings were used on the CG4-A glider which was instrumental in the invasion of Sicily in 1943 and the D-Day invasion in Normandy on June 6, 1944.

Timberland isn't owned by the Ku Klux Klan, nor does it have any such connections. This very successful outfitter was founded in 1952 by Nathan Swartz. It remained a family-owned business until 1987, when Sidney Swartz (Nathan's son) took the company public. Timberland now trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol TBL, and in 2000 its consolidated revenue totaled $1.1 billion. As for who runs the company, according to the corporate profile on Timberland's site: Our company was founded by Nathan Swartz, whose legacy of craftsmanship, integrity and quality is carried on today through the active involvement of his son, Sidney Swartz, Chairman, and his grandson, Jeffrey Swartz, President and Chief Executive Officer. As of March 28, 2003, the Swartz family, together with trusts and a charitable foundation established by the family, held approximately 46% of Timberland stock and approximately 82% of voting power. Jeffrey Swartz (the grandson of the founder and Timberland's President and CEO) has been a member of the board of City Year, the national youth organization that provides community service in 13 U.S. cities, since 1991 and its chair since 1994. He is also a director of several social justice organizations, including Business for Social Responsibility and Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston. He's hardly recruitment material for the KKK, even if he weren't Jewish. (The KKK regards Jews with about as much affection as it does African-Americans.) This rumor persists in part due to claims about the tree on Timberland's logo representing a tree on which blacks were lynched. (Apparently a tree can't just be a tree any more.) Snapple was subjected to a similar rumor having to do with the sailing ship then on its label: common knowledge had it the ship was a blackbirder, a vessel that brought slaves in chains to America. It wasn't the image came from a drawing of the Boston Tea Party, but facts didn't long stand in the way of rumor, and the label was changed. Slanders about this or that company's being owned by the KKK are a dime a dozen, ranking right up there with equally fallacious claims about the CEOs of such companies appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show to utter appallingly disparaging comments about blacks. (Sometimes these mythical CEOs announce that their companies tithe to the Church of Satan, which vilifies them to an even wider audience.)

This brand of fashionable urban athletic wear was introduced in 1985.

(The notion that the KKK would consider blacks \"oppressed\" apparently never struck the rumormongers as laughable.) In a widely-believed embellishment of the basic rumor, the KKK had inserted into the lining of Troop jackets little slips of paper trumpeting either \"To rule over oppressed people\" or \"Thank you nigger for making us rich,\" the latter phrase said to have been inscribed in the tread of Troop's tennis shoes as well. (These claims of hidden messages in Troop products could be read as an inverted form of The Rattletrap legend, in which a disgruntled worker hides spiteful messages intended to irritate the rich customers who are supporting the exploitation of his labor; in the Troop legend, pleased owners hide spiteful messages intended to taunt the poor minority consumers they themselves are exploiting.) Rumors run on very fast legs, with more damning accusations added to them as they speed along. Soon folks were insisting they'd seen LL Cool J on the Oprah Winfrey Show denounce Troop as a KKK-run shop and rip off his Troop jacket in a demonstration of disgust. (Oprah's show is apparently the place to unmask evil corporations the same theme of making a shocking revelation about a clothier shows up in the Liz Claiborne and Tommy Hilfiger canards.) Or, in an inverted form of the rumor, LL Cool J was accused of being a KKK pied piper leading his people to unwittingly finance white supremacy by popularizing Troop clothing. Troop of course never had any ties to the Ku Klux Klan or any similar organization. Its founders were decidedly not KKK material: Teddy and Harvey Held are Jewish, and William Kim is Korean. Not that such facts slowed the spread of the rumor; once that ball was in play, it was going to stay there no matter what anyone said. Trying to combat the rumor with a hands-on demonstration of its falsity, Troop's black marketing director, Wesley Mallory, sliced open the linings of five such jackets in a store in Montgomery, Alabama, to prove such messages weren't hidden inside. Troop never did overcome the rumors that surrounded it, and less than five years after it began operations it was forced into bankruptcy. Its owners discounted the effect of the slander on this outcome, citing bad business decisions and the public's fickleness as the primary reasons for Troop's demise.

Moments like that make each of us want to reveal ourselves as millionaires in disguise, if only to turn the tables on the superior-acting one.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "As far as we know, this legend has yet to come true. Although it's an oft-told tale, we have yet to find a verifiable instance of a going concern's being purchased by a rich man looking to fire the bugger who'd insulted him.

Next time the sales clerk looks down his nose at you, tell him about John Barrier and the Washington State bank that refused to validate his parking. John Barrier had done business with Old National Bank (now U.S. Bank) in Spokane, Washington, for 30 years. He'd made his money buying and refurbishing old buildings and was wearing his usual shabby clothes that day in October 1988 when he left his pickup truck in a nearby parking lot while he paid a visit to his broker, then cashed a cheque at the bank. The teller, however, took one look at his grubby clothes and refused to stamp the parking bill. As a news story of the time read: \"She told me the bank only validated parking tickets when a customer made a transaction and that cashing a check wasn't a transaction,\" said Barrier. The millionaire said he asked the teller to call a bank manager, who also refused. \"He looked me up and down and stood back and gave me one of those kinds of looks,\" said Barrier, turning up his nose to imitate the manager. \"I said, 'Fine, you don't need me and I don't need you.\"' Barrier withdrew all his money and took it down the street to Seafirst Bank. \"The first check he brought me was for $1 million,\" said Dennis Veter, vice president of Seafirst's main Spokane branch. \"You'd never know by looking at him, but you or I should be so lucky.\" As John Barrier said: \"If you have

"Every now and then, a long-lived rumor spawns a real-life counterpart when someone in the business world comes to the startling realization that there is corporate gold to be mined by cashing in on what people are already committed to believing. Thus, thanks to the infamous $250 cookie recipe legend Neiman-Marcus now sells a chocolate chip cookie, and McDonald's (on behalf of its Ronald McDonald Houses) collects pull tabs for a charitable cause.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Another potential entry in this category is American Express, a company dogged for years by a rumor that it handed out black AmEx cards entitling holders to purchase anything up to jet fighters and beyond. While people insist a few of those fabled cards were provided to the ultra-privileged (those who had millions of dollars in American Express bank accounts; Imelda Marcos and the like) from 1984 to 1987, and a 1988 Wall Street Journal article appears to support that claim, whatever the truth about those chargeplates of lore, in 1999 the corporation finally bowed to the belief and began openly offering a real card at least somewhat in line with the rumor. (It's possible AmEx issued a special card that wasn't a chargeplate to the super-privileged back in the 1980s. That 1988 Wall Street Journal article described the black card as \"high-class ID for check-cashing\" even as it made clear nothing could be charged on the card; AmEx cardholders were still required to use their platinum, gold, or green cards to make purchases.) In 1999 American Express announced the introduction of its Centurion card. Available only by invitation to selected Platinum card members, this black credit card promises to simplify the lives of the harried rich. In exchange for its hefty annual fee (initially $1,000 US, but now $2,500), cardholders receive automatic upgrades on fifteen of the world's leading airlines. They also receive assistance in securing hard-to-come-by tickets for popular events, reservations at trendy restaurants, and shopping for Christmas gifts. Someone from the service will even call to remind cardholders of upcoming anniversaries. It is akin to having a personal concierge always on call. \"There had been rumors going around that we had this ultra-exclusive black card for elite customers,\" says Doug Smith, director of American Express Europe. \"It wasn't true, but we decided to capitalize on the idea anyway. So far we've had a customer buy a Bentley and another charter a jet.\" Other card member tales: One cardholder wanted to locate and purchase the horse ridden by Kevin Costner in Dances with Wolves. The horse was located in a stud ranch in Mexico, purchased and delivered to Europe. Another cardholder wanted a handful of sand from the Dead Sea for a child's school project on the Holy Land. Someone was dispatched by motorcycle to the shores of the Dead Sea to obtain the sand, which was couriered back to London. Yet another cardholder required American Express to organize a wedding, including designing the wedding card, drawing maps to direct guests to the banquet, renting tuxedos and shoes for guests, and preparing the hotel room with a jacuzzi for the wedding night. And for another cardholder who aspired to be an actress and wanted to be part of the crew of a weekly soap opera on TV, American Express contacted the director and arranged for an audition. According to cardholder and record producer Nellee Hooper, the Centurion \"arrives at your house with a security guard. You get this big, black, velvet-lined box, with a special mini-computer and two black cards in it, one for business, one for pleasure.\" If you put your card in the mini-computer, it tells you how much you've spent. Hooper was probably attempting to add to the black card's mystique by speaking with his tongue planted in his cheek, however. Some of our readers who possess Centurion cards have reported that their new plastic arrived with no hoopla at all, nary a security guard nor a mini-computer. They did receive two cards, but it wasn't a case of one card for business and one for pleasure one card was the Centurion charge card and the other was a 'Priority Pass' (also black and gold) which allows them into first-class lounges the world over but can't actually be used to pay for anything. Yet for all of its snob appeal, the Centurion is still a thing of mystery. Though we located numerous references to it on the American Express web site, nothing we came across explicitly outlined its eligibility requirements or benefits. The card cannot be applied for; it is either proffered by AmEx or it is not. As to how the company decides whom it should offer the preferred plastic to, according to American Express their applications for Centurion cards are generally provided to customers who annually charge $150,000 or more to other AmEx cards. Centurion cards are not offered to anyone who has been a cardholder for less than a year. Long ago, when all that existed was the rumor, we asked ourselves what value there would be in having credit cards so little known they would not be recognized by merchants when presented. Apparently that minor consideration pales in the light of the chargeplates' inherent cachet at least in their users' eyes, their scarcity seems to more than counterbalance the occasional store clerk's viewing them with suspicion. Black charge cards have progressed from the realm of urban lore into reality. The black AmEx is now not even unique in that Britain's NatWest came out with its version of an ebony premium charge card in 2002. Given the annual fees attaching to such premium cards and in light of the interest rates they carry, we're quite content with our less dusky plastic.

reference to it in pamphlets given out to new depositors (as an example of some of the unusual things people have used as checks). Nonetheless, it's a completely fabricated tale, and it springs straight from the adventures of one Albert Haddock, the fictitious and fanciful creation of British writer A.P. Herbert.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Herbert's book Uncommon Law was first published in 1935. Herbert himself was called to the English Bar but never practiced, choosing another career path instead. He was a regular contributor to Punch for more than fifty years and the author of eight novels. He became a member of Parliament in 1935 and fought successfully for the reform of many licensing, divorce, and obscenity laws. Okay, now you know a bit about the author. As for his wondrous creation, Albert Haddock, here's a bit from the introduction to Uncommon Law: Albert Haddock made his first public appearance in Punch about 1924. I have always understood that I invented him, but he has made some disturbing escapes into real life. The first of the first series of Misleading Cases shown by the BBC on television in 1967 was No. 32 \"Board of Inland Revenue v. Haddock\" where Haddock, in payment of income tax, made out a cheque on a cow and led it to the office of the Collector of Taxes. Some weeks later I received a spacious cutting from an American newspaper (the Memphis Press-Scimitar) headed: A CHECK CAN BE WRITTEN ON A COW The article made not the slightest reference to me, my work, or the BBC, but used as news all Haddock's arguments and opinions on unconventional cheques. Halfway through, it suddenly claimed the authority of the Chase Manhattan Bank for the particular case of the cow: 'In the 19th century an Englishman named Albert Haddock got mad at the local tax collector over his bill and conceived a most ingenious idea for getting even.' Then followed the whole story. 19th century indeed! Haddock wasn't a real person any more than Sherlock Holmes was. A.P. Herbert loved writing about the law, so he created Haddock as an ongoing character upon whom he could hang his fanciful stories. The BBC's Misleading Cases comedy series, based on the exploits of the fictional Albert Haddock, used this one of Herbert's tales for its premier episode (\"The Negotiable Cow,\" originally aired 20 June 1967); someone at the Memphis Press-Scimitar picked up on it, didn't get the joke, and presented it as something that really happened. Not content to leave well enough alone, the Press-Scimitar threw in the bit about the Chase Manhattan Bank to lend an extra bit of believability to the tale. One wonders how many cattle have been led into the Chase Manhattan Bank over the years thanks to the Press-Scimitar's gullibility. (NOTE: A number of Internet sources cite the 1985 edition of Michael Liepner's Applying the Law as documentation of the claim that \"In Canada during the 1930s, a farmer painted a cheque on the side of a cow and cashed it.\" This citation is erroneous: the referenced book contains no such statement.)

And although most bank customers are aware their deposits are insured, they aren't necessarily familiar with the details of how that insurance works, a circumstance that has fostered the spread of rumors which create additional insecurity.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "After a wave of bank failures that came in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929 and the prolonged economic depression that followed, the U.S. federal government created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) to restore public confidence in (and help stabilize) the U.S. banking system. The FDIC provided federal government guarantees of deposits up to $100,000 per account holder per bank (and up to $250,000 per account holder for deposit retirement accounts), subject to certain conditions, at insured financial institutions.* Bank failures in the U.S. have been a relatively uncommon phenomenon since the savings-and-loan crisis of the late 1980s, so many consumers have had little or no exposure to the process by which FDIC deposit insurance works, a circumstance that has led to the uncertainty reflected in the examples cited above. Widely-believed rumors hold that FDIC insurance actually covers just a small fraction of the original deposit amount (e.g., 1.5%), or that the FDIC only reimburses depositors in full over a very long period of time (e.g., 99 years ), the net result being the mistaken belief that FDIC insurance isn't really much of a guarantee at all. In fact, these rumors are so prevalent that they were both included (as numbers #3 and #4) in a list of the top ten misconceptions about the FDIC published in the Spring 2006 edition of the FDIC Consumer News newsletter, where they were addressed thusly: If a bank fails, the FDIC could take up to 99 years to pay depositors for their insured accounts. This is a completely false notion that many bank customers have told us they heard from someone attempting to sell them another kind of financial product. The truth is that federal law requires the FDIC to pay the insured deposits \"as soon as possible\" after an insured bank fails. Historically, the FDIC pays insured deposits within a few days after a bank closes, usually the next business day. In most cases, the FDIC will provide each depositor with a new account at another insured bank. Or, if arrangements cannot be made with another institution, the FDIC will issue a check to each depositor. The FDIC only pays failed-bank depositors a percentage of their insured funds. All too often we receive questions similar to this one: \"Is it true that if my FDIC-insured bank fails, I would only get $1.31 for every $100 in my checking account?\" As with misconception number 3, this misinformation appears to be spread by some financial advisors and sales people. Federal law requires the FDIC to pay 100 percent of the insured deposits up to the federal limit including principal and interest. If your bank fails and you have deposits over the limit, you may be able to recover some or, in rare cases, all of your uninsured funds. However, the overwhelming majority of depositors at failed institutions are within the insurance limit, and insured funds are always paid in full. As noted, this type of misinformation is often passed along by unscrupulous or misinformed financial advisors who are trying to steer customers towards investments or accounts that are not insured, so if you have any doubts about exactly what is or is not covered by FDIC insurance, you may want to undertake some additional verification on your own. * Note: In October 2008 the FDIC insurance limit was temporarily increased to $250,000 per account, with that increase slated to remain in effect through the end of 2009, but subsequently extended through the end of 2013. In July 2010 the FDIC insurance limit was permanently increased to $250,000 per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/changes.html;http://www.fdic.gov/;", "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, July 2008] I heard an \"expert\" on KFI AM 640 in LA say the FDIC has up to 99 years to repay you in the event of a bank failure.

The teller asks why is he depositing such a small check. His response is that his bank went bust and that the checks are from the F.D.I.C.

This was an aspect of human nature gainfully exploited by con man Frank Abagnale (of Catch Me If You Can fame), who, after obtaining a genuine Pan Am pilot's uniform (as well as forging a Pan Am ID card and FAA pilot's license), supposedly spent several years taking free flights and passing bad checks all over the USA and Europe. Another legendary scam which plays on our hesitance to challenge the uniformed involves the crook who garbs himself as a security guard, places a sign reading \"NIGHT DEPOSITORY OUT OF ORDER Please leave deposits with guard\" in front of a bank's night depository, and stands off to the side with a large cart, into which he places the money and receipts handed to him by trusting customers. The crook then makes off into the night with the deposits, keeping the cash and tossing the receipts.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Abagnale himself claims to have pulled off this scam: I went first to Beke Brothers. No one questioned my status. Within fifteen minutes I walked out with a complete guard's outfit: shirt, tie, trousers and hat, the name of the bank emblazoned over the breast pocket and on the right shoulder of the shirt ... At 11:15 P.M. I was standing at attention in front of the night-deposit box of [a bank's airport branch], and a beautifully lettered sign adorned the safe's depository: \"NIGHT DEPOSIT VAULT OUT OF ORDER. PLEASE MAKE DEPOSITS WITH SECURITY OFFICER.\" There was an upright dolly, with a large mail-type bag bulking open, in front of the depository. At least thirty-five people dropped bags or envelopes into the container. Not one of them said more than \"Good evening\" or \"Good night.\" Whether Abagnale actually did this or merely attributed to himself a scam he'd heard about is debatable (since much of what went into his memoirs was fictitious or exaggerated, and especially since he claimed to have pulled off this theft at the very same airport where he'd just been arrested by state troopers for impersonating a pilot the day before). However, others have successfully pulled off this ruse, most recently in Tigard, Oregon, in August 2008: Two men made off with hundreds of dollars in cash by dressing as security guards, standing outside a bank's night deposit slot and persuading people to hand over their money because the slot was broken. The men offered to make the deposits for customers at the Washington Square branch of Wells Fargo Bank the next day when the bank reopened, said Jim Wolf, a Tigard Police Department spokesman. \"Wells Fargo had absolutely no idea who these men were,\" Wolf said. He said the men wore uniforms and had badges and guns. The night deposit slot was covered by a blue engraved sign saying it was out of order. The men offered to collect the deposits by putting them in a black box they had, Wolf said. The deposits came from businesses that normally use the slot to deposit the day's receipts from their tills. Two people who gave deposits to the men said the sign over the slot read \"Out of Service.\" Sightings: A couple of characters in Neil Gaiman's 2001 novel, American Gods , pull off this scam at a bank's ATM: [Wednesday] put a peaked cap on, and Velcroed a patch to the left breast pocket of his jacket. A1 SECURITY was written on the cap and the patch. He put deposit slips on his clipboard. Then he slouched. He looked like a retired beat cop ... Wednesday taped a large red out-of-order notice to the ATM. He put a red ribbon across the night deposit slot, and he taped a photocopied sign up above it. Shadow read it with amusement. FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE, it said, WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE ONGOING IMPROVEMENT'S. WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE TEMPORARY INCONVENIENCE. Then Wednesday turned around and faced the street. He looked cold and put-upon. A young woman came over to use the ATM. Wednesday shook his head, explained that it was out of order. She cursed, apologized for cursing, and ran off. A car drew up, and a man got out holding a small gray sack and a key. Shadow watched as Wednesday apologized to the man, then made him sign the clipboard, checked his deposit slip, painstakingly wrote him out a receipt and puzzled over which copy to keep, and, finally, opened his big black metal case and put the man's sack inside. The man shivered in the snow, stamping his feet, waiting for the old security guard to be done with this administrative nonsense, so he could leave his takings and get out of the cold and be on his way, then he took his receipt and got back into his warm car and drove off. [Wednesday] took gray sacks and envelopes from people coming to deposit their earnings or their takings on this Saturday afternoon, a fine old security man in his funny pink earmuffs ...

implementing a policy that requires customers making cash deposits to show identification and that prohibits customers from depositing cash into personal accounts on which they are not listed as account holders:", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The policy applies only to cash deposits (not negotiables such as checks or money orders) and only to deposits made into consumer and business accounts (not investment, Treasury and commercial accounts). The restrictions, for example, limit the ability of parents to deposit cash into the accounts of their children who might be away from home (e.g., at college or on vacation) if the parents are not listed as joint account holders, but Chase customers can add authorized signers to their accounts to work around this limitation. According to a Chase spokesperson, the policy change was related to efforts to bolster the bank's anti-money laundering efforts: \"It's an excellent idea. I guarantee other banks will follow suit very shortly if they're smart,\" said Annemarie McAvoy, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches anti-money laundering and counterterrorism at Fordham Law School. \"The hard thing with cash is you can't tell where it's coming from once it goes into an account,\" said McAvoy. \"I think Chase is trying very hard to be ahead of the curve. Part of it is they are under the microscope [due to a $2 billion settlement over criminal charges related to the Madoff scandal], but I think they are really trying to do the right thing.\" It is not accurate to say that this limitation on cash deposits is \"banking law,\" however. Banks are required by law to report cash transactions exceeding $10,000, but they are not required to turn down cash deposits made by non-account holders the latter restriction is purely a voluntary policy that Chase has chosen to implement on its own; other banks may or may not follow suit.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2014/01/07/doj-jpmorgan-to-pay-madoff-victims-17b/;http://personal.crocodoc.com/4BvhQwQ;", "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, July 2008] Chase bank this morning would not accept cash deposit, when the person depositing the cash was not the account holder.

However, \"seemingly\" is only a chimera, in that entering one's Personal Identification Number (PIN) in reverse at Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) does not summon the police.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 compelled the Federal Trade Commission to provide an analysis of any technology, either then currently available or under development, which would allow a distressed ATM user to send an electronic alert to a law enforcement agency. The following statements were made in the FTC's April 2010 report in response to that requirement: FTC staff learned that emergency-PIN technologies have never been deployed at any ATMs. The respondent banks reported that none of their ATMs currently have installed, or have ever had installed, an emergency-PIN system of any sort. The ATM manufacturer Diebold confirms that, to its knowledge, no ATMs have or have had an emergency-PIN system. Ergo, there aren't and haven't ever been \"reverse PIN\" technologies despite Internet-circulated claims dating to September 2006 that anyone being robbed at an ATM simply had to enter his or her PIN in reverse to summon help. Moreover, said that FTC report: The available information suggests that emergency-PIN and alarm button devices: (1) may not halt or deter crimes to any significant extent; (2) may in some instances increase the danger to customers who are targeted by offenders and also lead to some false alarms (although the exact magnitude of these potential effects cannot be determined); and (3) may impose substantial implementation costs, although no formally derived cost estimates of implementing these technologies are currently available. The reverse PIN system was first imagined in 1994 and patented in 1998 by Joseph Zingher, a Chicago businessman. His SafetyPIN System would alert police that a crime was in progress when a cardholder at an ATM keyed in the reverse of his personal identification numbers. The flip-flopped PIN would serve as a \"panic code\" that sent a silent alarm to police to notify them that an ATM customer was acting under duress. Because palindromic PINs (e.g., 2002, 7337, 4884) cannot be reversed, Zingher's system included work-arounds for such numeric combinations. However, Zingher had little success in interesting the banking community in SafetyPIN despite his pitching it to them with great persistence over the years. He did in 2004 succeed in getting the Illinois General Assembly to adopt a \"reverse PIN\" clause in SB 562, but the final version of the bill watered down the wording so as to make banks' implementation of the system optional rather than mandatory: \"A terminal operated in this State may be designed and programmed so that when a consumer enters his or her personal identification number in reverse order, the terminal automatically sends an alarm to the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the terminal location.\" In 2006, Michael Boyd pressed the Georgia State Assembly to pass a law requiring banks to create ATM panic codes that would operate the machines normally while also alerting police. His wife, Kimberly Boyd, was killed on 12 September 2005 after being carjacked by convicted sex offender Brian O'Neil Clark and forced to withdraw cash at an ATM. (She died when Clark crashed her SUV while being followed by a civilian who ultimately shot Clark to death afterwards.) Such a bill was placed before the Georgia Senate on 29 December 2005 (SB 379), but nothing came of it. In 2004, the Kansas state senate sent to its Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee SB 333, a bill that stated: \"Any automated teller machine operated in this state shall be designed and programmed so that when a consumer enters such consumer's personal identification number in reverse order, the automated teller machine automatically sends an alarm to the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the automated teller machine location.\" That bill died in committee that year. All this talk of various bills in three different state legislatures may serve to obscure some of the more important points attaching to this issue, points that are key to making up one's mind about whether having such a system in place is actually a good idea. No one in the banking industry seems to want the technology. The banks argue against its implementation, not only on the basis of cost but also because they doubt such an alert would help anyone being coerced into making an ATM withdrawal. Even if police could be summoned via the keying of a special \"alert\" or \"panic\" code, they say, law enforcement would likely arrive long after victim and captor had departed. They have also warned of the very real possibility that victims' fumbling around while trying to trigger silent alarms could cause their captors to realize something was up and take those realizations out on their captives. Finally, there is the problem of ATM customers' quickly conjuring up their accustomed PINs in reverse: Even in situations lacking added stress, mentally reconstructing one's PIN backwards is a difficult task for many people. Add to that difficulty the terror of being in the possession of a violent and armed person, and precious few victims might be able to come up with reversed PINs seamlessly enough to fool their captors into believing that everything was proceeding according to plan. As Chuck Stones of the Kansas Bankers Association said in 2004: \"I'm not sure anyone here could remember their PIN numbers backward with a gun to their head.\" Barbara \"neither Smith nor Wesson is known to prompt mental acuity in those they are pointed at\" Mikkelson", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.kslegislature.org/li/m/historical/committees/minutes/03_04/senate/SnFII2-5-2004.pdf;http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2005_06/versions/sb379_SB_379_PF_2.htm;http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&SessionId=3&GA=93&DocTypeId=SB&DocNum=562&GAID=3&LegID=3193;http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/05/100504creditcardreport.pdf;", "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, October 2006] I just found out that should you ever be forced to withdraw monies from an ATM machine, you can notify the police by entering your Pin # in reverse.

be?\" is a question often used in spoofs of the Barbara Walters style of fluff celebrity interviews.* Thanks to Chase Visa, we finally know how to answer that question should it ever be posed to us: \"I'd like to be the kind of tree that has its own charge account.\"", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Many of us have tried because we were tired of getting \"junk mail\" solicitations, wanted to prove how easy it is for just about anyone to obtain a credit card, or were simply in a prankish mood submitting credit card applications with nonsensical information: filling them out in the name of an infant, a pet, or a fictional character. And it's not uncommon for such efforts to succeed; stories about someone's successfully obtaining a credit card for his infant daughter, a pet chihuahua, or Mickey Mouse are fairly common news fodder. However, in December 2005 a West Hollywood realtor achieved something we'd never heard of before: he got a credit card issued to a tree. Recent changes to U.S. bankruptcy laws have made it more attractive for banks to offer credit cards to customers they might ordinarily have spurned (such as those just emerging from bankruptcy) or to offer more credit to existing customers. One result of this change is that many people have been seeing a flurry of credit card solicitations from various lenders in their daily mail. One such person, a West Hollywood realtor by the name of Gary More, grew annoyed at the plethora of unwanted credit card applications he was receiving and tried calling the issuers to put a stop to all the junk mail. After that approach failed to achieve the desired results, he took one of the many unwanted solicitations in hand, scrawled the words \"Never waste a tree\" across it (as his way of telling the sender to stop wasting paper), and mailed it in. And then ... you guessed it, Mr. More received a credit card from Chase Visa, issued to one \"Never Waste Tree\": He declined to use the card (although a few bags of fertilizer might have been a symbolically relevant purchase) and instead cut it up. We're waiting for the inevitable follow-up of a card made out to a famous mineral, perhaps \"Mr. Plymouth Rock.\" * Barbara Walters never actually put this question to any of her interviewees. The belief that it was one of her standard queries took root when she interviewed Katharine Hepburn in 1981 the renowned actress likened herself to a tree, and Ms. Walters followed up the lead by asking her, \"What kind of tree?\" Innumerable parodies of Barbara Walters interviews have since seized on that exchange and planted in the public consciousness the notion that \"If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?\" is a genuine example of the inane types of questions commonly posed to celebrity subjects by interviewers such as Ms. Walters.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "", "Example": "", "Last Updated": "18 April 2011", "Credibility": "true", "URL": "www.snopes.com/business/bank/treecard.asp", "Claim": "A bank issued a credit card to a tree.", "Claim_ID": "business_bank_treecard", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/business/bank/treecard.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "whsbulldogs.wikispaces.com", "link": "http://whsbulldogs.wikispaces.com/share/view/2232355", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "articles.latimes.com", "link": "http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/07/local/me-only7", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "books.google.com.mx", "link": "https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=rlBeM-9BOg8C&pg=PA134&lpg=PA134&dq=A+bank+issued+a+credit+card+to+a+tree.&source=bl&ots=wE3wlghRfs&sig=nucm_kH6B2sz1sG1_ws1_vNALpg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_3vW9pr_KAhVHu4MKHQqADx4Q6AEILDAD", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "books.google.com.mx", "link": "https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=4WadcncjsRUC&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=A+bank+issued+a+credit+card+to+a+tree.&source=bl&ots=OPZacZW1Nw&sig=Pw9leBHS5ZhVg5itKRGAx6PE_c4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_3vW9pr_KAhVHu4MKHQqADx4Q6AEILzAE", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "books.google.com.mx", "link": "https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=slPl0K5PPBIC&pg=PT131&lpg=PT131&dq=A+bank+issued+a+credit+card+to+a+tree.&source=bl&ots=gHs8PBQtJq&sig=sw9oU2H6-R8Slwg1WCea2wq81To&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_3vW9pr_KAhVHu4MKHQqADx4Q6AEIMjAF", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.jpost.com", "link": "http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Norwegian-bank-issues-anti-Semetic-credit-card-says-sorry-413919", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.usbank.com", "link": "https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/compare.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "credocreditcard.com", "link": "http://credocreditcard.com/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "business.time.com", "link": "http://business.time.com/2012/11/07/5-credit-cards-you-dont-want-to-own/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.nature.org", "link": "http://www.nature.org/about-us/working-with-companies/the-nature-conservancy-visa-credit-card.xml", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.banktree.co.uk", "link": "http://www.banktree.co.uk/support/knowledgebase.php?article=16", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.fastcoexist.com", "link": "http://www.fastcoexist.com/3046029/buy-your-way-out-of-your-carbon-footprint-with-a-credit-card-that-saves-trees-with-every-pur", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "articles.braintreepayments.com", "link": "https://articles.braintreepayments.com/control-panel/transactions/refunds-voids-credits", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "developers.braintreepayments.com", "link": "https://developers.braintreepayments.com/reference/general/testing/ruby", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.mstreetbank.com", "link": "https://www.mstreetbank.com/visa-credit-card/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "books.google.com.mx", "link": "https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=FJcuYd7AEjsC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218&dq=A+bank+issued+a+credit+card+to+a+tree.&source=bl&ots=j_eXlxB6S4&sig=ASm2fwX1nxId-n6JdUquzrBeHG0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiB6N6_pr_KAhXIvYMKHRC-BFg4FBDoAQgZMAA", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.woodlandtrust.org.uk", "link": "https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/support-us/woodland-trust-credit-card/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.nerdwallet.com", "link": "http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/lending-club-prosper-good-options-consolidating-credit-card-debt/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.hsbc.co.in", "link": "http://www.hsbc.co.in/1/2/miscellaneous/call-us-ivr/call-us-ivr1", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.lendingmemo.com", "link": "http://www.lendingmemo.com/credit-cards-vs-lending-club/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.ontrees.com", "link": "https://www.ontrees.com/help-connecting", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.paypal.com", "link": "https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-popup", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "hhonors3.hilton.com", "link": "http://hhonors3.hilton.com/en/earn-use-points/credit-cards/index.html", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "Corrupted data, client pressures, and looming deadlines work to combine into a lurking potential for disaster in direct mail campaigns. Sometimes that potential gets realized in hilarious fashion when one small thing, one very little thing, is inadvertently overlooked in the maelstrom inherent to getting a project of such nature underway. Such was the case here.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "In the early 1990s, a small UK-based company that performed bureau work for direct marketing campaigns on behalf of third parties did indeed make the \"Dear Rich Bastard\" gaffe. That gaffe came about after the company had undertaken a project to assist one of the largest UK telecom companies in launching a new 'gold' calling card, a project that included drawing information from a database in order to address and personalize letters tendering the product to prospective customers. Some of the data the company had to work with was munged (i.e., badly or inconsistently formatted) beyond fixability, which meant that while most of those who received the offer would get letters properly saluting them as \"Dear Dr. Smith\" or \"Dear Rev. Jones,\" others would by nature of the poor quality of their name field data have to be addressed as \"Dear Customer,\" \"Dear Reader,\" or by whatever other generic salutation was eventually decided upon. And therein lay the trap. As potential wordings were bandied back and forth, the work on the actual data extraction program had to continue, and some placeholder phrase needed to be assigned for use with records containing munged name field data. A whimsical programmer hit upon his own temporary salutation for such records: \"Dear Rich Bastard.\" Such a greeting should have been wholly replaced as soon as word came down about what the official salutation was to be (e.g., \"Dear Future Customer\"), yet that step was overlooked because the work on the coding project was stopped and restarted a number of times, and during the interim a different programmer one who did not know about the \"Dear Rich Bastard\" placeholder took over the task. When the project finally came to fruition, the \"Dear Rich Bastard\" placeholder was still in place. Hundreds of thousands of letters were produced and mailed without anyone's being the wiser as to what those potential customers whose name field data had proved irreparable would receive. Only a very small number of \"Dear Rich Bastard\" missives actually went out, rather than the 2,000 commonly stated in tellings of this event. (There weren't that many munged entries in the database, after all.) However, visits to all of the affected companies had to be made and appropriate apologies tendered in person. (At one office so mea culpa'd, an enlargement of the \"Dear Rich Bastard\" letter was spotted framed and mounted on the wall.) Contrary to the myth that surrounds this story, the programmer responsible for the embarrassing salutation that inadvertently escaped into the wild was not fired. An interesting element not generally related as part of this story just goes to prove you can never please everyone: The little UK firm responsible for the gaffe received a complaint from a potential customer who felt himself qualified to be a rich bastard yet had not received the letter he deemed appropriate to his station in life. Mess-ups have found their way into other mass mailings. A similar situation occurred when U.S. vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro's computer sent out letters thanking supporters for their help in her 1984 campaign. Supporters with the title \"Mrs.\" found themselves addressed as \"Rabbi\", while all those with the title \"Mr.\" were promoted to \"Colonel\". Someone performing data entry had mistyped the numeric code for certain fields, requiring 5,000 letters of apology to be sent out to correct the gaffe. In another related tale, also true, a Wells Fargo EquityLine statement of 2 February 1988 carried the following message at the bottom: You owe your soul to the company store. Why not owe your home to Wells Fargo? An equity advantage loan can help you spend what would have been your children's inheritance. Nine days later, Wells Fargo sent out the following letter: I wish to extend my personal apology for a message printed on your EquityLine statement dated February 2, 1988. This message was not a legitimate one. It was developed as part of a test program by a staff member, whose sense of humor was somewhat misplaced, and it was inadvertently inserted in that day's statement mailing. The message in no way conveys the opinion of Wells Fargo Bank or its employees. James G. Jones, Executive Vice President, South Bay Service Center Wells Fargo spokesperson Kim Kellogg said, \"From now on, we're just going to type, 'Testing One, Two, Three' at the bottom.\" Barbara \"some banks issue statements; others, apologies\" Mikkelson", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=;", "Example": "[Collected on the Internet, 1997] The National Westminster Bank in England admitted last month that it keeps personal information about its customers such as their political affiliation on computer.

By 1995 Continental had turned around, posting the first of 11 straight quarters of record profits, increasing its stock price from $3.25 to over $50 per share, and consistently ranking among the best airlines in customer satisfaction surveys.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Gordon Bethune's emphasis in turning Continental Airlines around \"from worst to first,\" as he explained in his 1998 book of the same title, was in satisfying customers and employees and ensuring that both groups remained happy with the way Continental treated them. However, he also made it clear that the maxim \"the customer is always right\" didn't hold sway at Continental, and that when conflicts arose between employees and unruly customers, he would come down squarely on the side of his employees: [W]hen we run into customers that we can't reel back in, our loyalty is with our employees. They have to put up with this stuff every day. Just because you buy a ticket does not give you the right to abuse our employees ... [W]e run more than 3 million people through our books every month. One or two of those people are going to be unreasonable, demanding jerks. When it's a choice between supporting your employees, who work with you every day and make your product what it is, or some irate jerk who demands a free ticket to Paris because you ran out of peanuts, whose side are you going to be on? You can't treat your employees like serfs. You have to value them ... [I]f they think that you won't support them when a customer is out of line, even the smallest problem can cause resentment. He also provided an example of an incident somewhat similar to the rumor cited above, one in which he wholeheartedly supported a flight attendant who had to deal with a passenger he considered disruptive and unreasonable: A Continental flight attendant once was offended by a passenger's child wearing a hat with Nazi and KKK emblems on it. It was pretty offensive stuff, so the attendant went to the kid's father and asked him to put away the hat. \"No,\" the guy said. \"My kid can wear what he wants, and I don't care who likes it.\" The flight attendant went into the cockpit and got the first officer, who explained to the passenger the FAA regulation that makes it a crime to interfere with the duties of a crew member. The hat was causing other passengers and the crew discomfort, and that interfered with the flight attendant's duties. The guy better put away the hat. He did, but he didn't like it. He wrote many nasty letters. We made every effort to explain our policy and the federal air regulations, but he wasn't hearing it. He even showed up in our executive suite to discuss the matter with me. I let him sit out there. I didn't want to see him and I didn't want to listen to him. He bought a ticket on our airplane, and that means we'll take him where he wants to go. But if he's going to be rude and offensive, he's welcome to fly another airline. This background makes the rumor cited above sound at least plausible. But did it really happen? Since nothing says it did other than some anonymous, non-specific Internet rumor, and Gordon Bethune himself dismissed it as \"just a rumor\" when asked about it at meetings with Continental employees, we have to say no. (Bethune reveled in telling the world that he doesn't tolerate \"unreasonable, demanding jerks\" who \"abuse our employees,\" so there was no obvious motive for him to deny the story if it were true. And if he were initially keeping mum because the booted passenger had threatened to sue the airline, at least some mention of the incident should have turned up in the business press by now.) As well, in a hallmark of urban legendry, we've also found this story attributed to similar maverick figures in the airline industry, including Robert Six, the former head of Continental, and Herb Kelleher, one of the founders of Southwest Airlines. Kelleher, too, has gone on record with the philosophy that supporting one's employees is more important than catering to abusive customers, as in this excerpt from a July 1995 Reader's Digest \"Personal Glimpses\" feature: While Southwest Airlines CEO Herb Kelleher gives customers a terrific deal on an airplane seat, he makes it clear that his employees come first even if it means dismissing customers. But aren't customers always right? \"No, they are not,\" Kelleher snaps. \"And I think that's one of the biggest betrayals of employees a boss can possibly commit. The customer is sometimes wrong. We don't carry those sorts of customers. We write to them and say, 'Fly somebody else. Don't abuse our people.'\" An example of Kelleher's putting his philosophy into action is found in Nuts! , a 1996 volume chronicling the success of Southwest Airlines: Jim Ruppel, director of customer relations, and Sherry Phelps, director of corporate employment, tell the story of a woman who frequently flew on Southwest, but was disappointed with every aspect of the company's operation. In fact, she became known as the \"Pen Pal\" because after every flight she wrote in with a complaint. She didn't like the fact that the company didn't assign seats; she didn't like the absence of a first-class section; she didn't like not having a meal in flight; she didn't like Southwest's boarding procedure; she didn't like the flight attendants' sporty uniforms and the casual atmosphere. And she hated peanuts! Her last letter, reciting a litany of complaints, momentarily stumped Southwest's customer relations people. Phelps explains: \"Southwest prides itself on answering every letter that comes to the company and several employees tried to respond to this customer, patiently explaining why we do things the way we do them. [Our response] was quickly becoming a [large] volume until they bumped it up to Herb's desk, with a note: 'This one's yours.' In sixty seconds, Kelleher wrote back and said, 'Dear Mrs. Crabapple, We will miss you. Love, Herb.'\" The likely truth here is that someone once concocted a \"let's cheer for the company head who doesn't take any guff from customers\" tale, and the anecdote has since been attributed to whichever aviation CEO is currently deemed most likely to have acted it out in real life. As for Gordon Bethune, he retired as CEO of Continental Airlines at the end of 2004, and the company was merged with United Airlines in 2010.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1885167180/ref=urbanlegendsrefe;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471248355/ref=urbanlegendsrefe;http://www.pbs.org/kcet/chasingthesun/innovators/hkelleher.html;http://travel.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0%2C7445%2C796303%2C00.html;", "Example": "On a recent CO flight, CEO Gordon Bethune had pre-boarded the aircraft and was sitting on the flight deck chatting with the Captain and First Officer.

Seeing several First Class seats open, he began to argue with the flight attendant over why he had not been upgraded. The flight attendant said she would get a gate agent to look into the matter, but the Elite member began swearing at her profusely. Gordon was on his way back from the cockpit when this occurred, and intervened, asking, \"Can I help somehow?\" The passenger said, \"Huh? Who the f*** are you?\" \"I'm the CEO of this company,\" Gordon replied. \"May I see your ticket, sir?\" The passenger gave his ticket to Gordon, who saw a total fare of just under six hundred dollars. He then pulled out his billfold and peeled off six $100 bills, placing them in the man's hand.

Mickey Mantle , in late 2010 another piece of crude sports-related correspondence surfaced on the Internet, prompting questions about whether scanned images of letters purportedly exchanged between an attorney and the Cleveland Browns football team were genuine.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The first missive, dated 18 November 1974 and addressed to the Cleveland Browns, was signed by Dale O. Cox of the Akron law firm Roetzel & Andress, a season ticket holder who complained about the potential for injury among spectators due to the practice of Browns fans' throwing paper airplanes during games at Cleveland Stadium: I am one of your season ticket holders who attends or tries to attend every game. It appears that one of the pastimes of several fans has become the sailing of paper airplanes generally made out of the game program. As you know, there is the risk of serious eye injury and perhaps an ear injury as a result of such airplanes. I am sure that this has been called to your attention and that several of your ushers and policemen witnessed the same. Please be advised that since you are in a position to control or terminate such action on the part of fans, I will hold you responsible for any injury sustained by any person in my party attending one of your sporting events. It is hoped that this disrespectful and possibly dangerous activity will be terminated. Three days later, Browns general counsel James N. Bailey responded with a terse, dismissive (and vulgar) reply: Attached is a letter that we received on November 19, 1974. I feel that you should be aware that some asshole is signing your name to stupid letters. This correspondence is in fact real, as Michael Heaton of the Cleveland Plain Dealer determined by tracking down both of the principals in late 2010, who vouched for its authenticity. Browns general counsel James Bailey, then 66 and living in San Diego, told Heaton that: It's surprising. I've gotten lots of calls from old friends who have seen the letter on the Internet. I was all of 28 years old when I wrote that letter. I should have been more cautious. I'm just glad my mother's not around to see that letter. After I wrote it, I heard about it right away from [Browns owner] Art Modell. He said something like, 'What the hell are you doing?' He was not a guy lacking passion. Dale Cox, formerly of the Roetzel & Andress law firm, who in 2010 was 72 with a private practice in Orofino, Idaho, also recalled for Heaton his memories of the exchange: I'm still a Browns season-ticket holder. I found out that Bailey and I both went to the University of Michigan Law School. No [I wasn't angry with his response]. I thought it was pretty cool. I've used that letter a couple times myself since.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "", "Example": "[Collected via the Internet, 2011]", "Last Updated": "15 January 2015", "Credibility": "true", "URL": "www.snopes.com/business/consumer/browns.asp", "Claim": "A lawyer received a caustic response after complaining to the Cleveland Browns about fans' throwing paper airplanes during home games.", "Claim_ID": "business_consumer_browns", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/business/consumer/browns.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "m.facebook.com", "link": "https://m.facebook.com/snopes/posts/718476078296914?comment_id=718500738294448&offset=0&total_comments=4&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R0%22%7D", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "m.facebook.com", "link": "https://m.facebook.com/OfficialRightWingNews/posts/1296536160406510?comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22O%22%7D", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.facebook.com", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/snopes/posts/718476078296914", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.facebook.com", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/SportsLaw/posts/1042922079073515", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.btcsavingplan.com", "link": "http://www.btcsavingplan.com/detail/id/Tattoo-Lettering-Fonts-%7C-Best-Tattoo-Design-Gallery", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.reddit.com", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3dj44q/best_response_ever_to_a_cease_and_desist_letter/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "paleaseoption.com", "link": "http://paleaseoption.com/tag/browns-relax-media-policy", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.faqla.com", "link": "http://www.faqla.com/ask/is-bailey-a-stupid-name-3586180/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "sccougar.com", "link": "http://sccougar.com/2015/12/22/brown-out.html", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "freeebookmpl.blogdetik.com", "link": "http://freeebookmpl.blogdetik.com/2015/01/16/downloadread-ebook-rollergirl-totally-true-tales-from-the-track", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "kellysfitness39.com", "link": "http://kellysfitness39.com/edu/about-my-dream-family/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "cattracks.net", "link": "http://cattracks.net/2015/12/brown-out/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "chicago.suntimes.com", "link": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/news-chicago/7/71/390494/cardinal-francis-george-dead-archdiocese-chicago", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "lbabout.kis.p.lodz.pl", "link": "http://lbabout.kis.p.lodz.pl/teaching_and_student_projects_files/files/ADS/words20k.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.datagrabber.org", "link": "http://www.datagrabber.org/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire/facebook-millionaire-final-answer-cheat-list/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.nevadalabor.com", "link": "http://www.nevadalabor.com/bulletins06d.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "ronmwangaguhunga.blogspot.com", "link": "http://ronmwangaguhunga.blogspot.com/2006_03_24_archive.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.yaf.org", "link": "http://www.yaf.org/point-loma-nazarene.aspx", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "link": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1292778/Belgium-considers-proposals-dissolve-bodies-flush-sewage-systems.html", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "www.countynewsonline.org", "link": "http://www.countynewsonline.org/archives/2011/dec/news.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "spiderbites.nytimes.com", "link": "http://spiderbites.nytimes.com/free_1911/articles_1911_12_00000.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "consorci.llucanes.cat", "link": "http://consorci.llucanes.cat/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=comment.ShowComments&g2_itemId=1422&g2_fromNavId=xff742b71", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.philwoods.com", "link": "http://www.philwoods.com/component/option,com_rsgallery2/Itemid,148/page,inline/id,31/catid,4/limitstart,1/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "archive.org", "link": "https://archive.org/stream/KSULKSColl196970V76N104131/KSUL_KS%20Coll_1969-70_v76_n104-131_djvu.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.motohit.si", "link": "http://www.motohit.si/?Arhiv_vseh_novic_%26amp%3B_dogodkov:8._SEJEM_MOTO_BOOM_V_CELJU&pic=1&page=0", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "stopthedrugwar.org", "link": "http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/422/full.shtml", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "issuu.com", "link": "http://issuu.com/expressnightout/docs/express_11022015", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "Cabbage Patch Kids were all the rage back in 1983-84. One did not purchase them; one \"adopted\" them. Proud new parents \"registered\" their adoption by filling in the form enclosed in the box the doll came in. Cabbage Patch Kids were loved. They were lavished with attention.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "They were ripe to become fodder for an urban legend. It wasn't long before sad tales of cold-hearted death certificates received instead of refurbished much-loved dollies began to make the rounds. Nothing to it, of course. But that didn't stop people from believing them. In some versions of the legend, the doll is returned in a little coffin suitable for burial. In others, the broken-hearted child is billed for her doll's funeral. Sometimes it's said a citation is issued to the bereaved kid for \"child abuse\". An interesting theory about how death certificates came to be associated with this toy (and far in addition to the obvious one of \"if a doll needs an adoption certificate for you to take one home, then it certainly requires a death certificate when it's too banged up to keep any longer\") involves the rock band NRBQ (New/National Rhythm & Blues Quartet). One of the (many) zany things they were doing back in 1984 was blowing up Cabbage Patch Kids onstage. In an article in Musician magazine, the band's keyboardist/leader, Terry Adams, said that the band was considering starting up a graveyard/funeral home where badly damaged Cabbage Patch Kids could be buried and laid to rest. Another link in the NRBQ chain comes from this 1985 news article: About a year ago, displaying its typically perverse commercial instincts, NRBQ jumped on the Cabbage Patch doll bandwagon. Because the country had fallen in love with the doll with the birth certificate, the group adopted the first Cabbage Patch doll with a death certificate. NRBQ exploded one doll with a firecracker at the Bayou in Washington, tarred and feathered another in Boston and made one walk the gangplank off a cruise ship in Baltimore Harbor. So the question remains: Did a rock group with an unusual sense of humor forge the original link in people's minds between Cabbage Patch Kids and death?

Here's a fine example from a 1948 cookbook, Massachusetts Cooking Rules, Old and New, which lists not only the recipe for \"$25 Fudge Cake\" but also gives the following explanation for the name: This friend had to pay $25 upon the receipt of the recipe from the chef of one of the railroads. She had asked for the recipe while eating on a train. The chef gladly sent it to her, together with a bill for $25, which her attorney said she had to pay. She then gave the recipe to all her friends, hoping they would get some pleasure from it. Sound disturbingly familiar? The 1960s saw this tale mutate into a villainization of New York's famed Waldorf-Astoria hotel over a dessert known as \"Red Velvet Cake.\" A woman who'd dined at the hotel later wrote to ask for the recipe. The recipe arrived ... along with a bill for $350, a bill her lawyer assured her she had to pay. Her way of getting even was you guessed it to distribute the recipe far and wide. ($350 was a shocking figure for those times. Just to give an idea of the relative worth of things back then, the grocery budget at my house was $50 a week for a family of four. Faced with a $35 dentist bill, my mother would for the next two weeks stand over me as I brushed my teeth at bedtime, making sure I wasn't half doing the job and thus sentencing the family to the poor house.) By the late 1970s, this legend had shifted to Mrs. Fields and chocolate chip cookies. Indeed, this version proved so fiendishly popular that in 1987 the following notice signed by Debbi Fields was displayed in her stores: Mrs. Fields recipe has never been sold. There is a rumor circulating that the Mrs. Fields Cookie recipe was sold to a woman at a cost of $250. A chocolate-chip cookie recipe was attached to the story. I would like to tell all my customers that this story is not true, this is not my recipe and I have not sold the recipe to anyone. Mrs. Fields recipe is a delicious trade secret. You rarely hear this tale told of Mrs. Fields these days the 1990s saw it shift yet again, this time to point a finger at Neiman-Marcus. One possible reason for this shift could have been a double misremembering of names as the legend was briefly told of the department store Marshall Fields: Mrs. Fields to Marshall Fields (similar name) and Marshall Fields to Neiman Marcus (similar-sounding name plus both are department stores). As the latest in a long line of victims, Neiman Marcus has fielded numerous inquiries about the following tale (which I've excerpted from the rather lengthy canonical version): My daughter & I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas & decided to have a small dessert. Because our family are such cookie lovers, we decided to try the \"Neiman-Marcus Cookie\". It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and they said with a small frown, \"I'm afraid not.\" Well, I said, would you let me buy the recipe? With a cute smile, she said, \"Yes.\" I asked how much, and she responded, \"Two fifty.\" I said with approval, just add it to my tab. Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and it was $285.00. I looked again and I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, \"Cookie Recipe - $250.00.\" Boy, was I upset!! I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it was \"two fifty,\" and I did not realize she meant $250.00 for a cookie recipe. (Neiman Marcus refuses to strike down the bill; then comes the usual exhortation from the writer to pass this along to as many as possible.) Especially in the particular case of Neiman Marcus, the legend is even more improbable than usual in that: There was no such thing as a \"Neiman-Marcus\" cookie when this tale began circulating about that company. They developed a chocolate chip cookie in response to the rumor. There is no \"Neiman Marcus Cafe\" at any of the chain's three Dallas-area stores. Instead, the restaurants are named Zodiac, Zodiac at North Park, and The Woods. Neiman Marcus does not sell recipes from its restaurants. The department store gives them away for free to anyone who asks and openly published their chocolate chip cookie recipe on their web site). As to why this legend has taken on a life of its own despite persistent and detailed debunkings, it's a classic David and Goliath story. It is, after all, the little guy smacking the big, heartless corporation a swift one right across the nose, something many people have often longed to do. This bit of netlore invites nay, demands participation. Painless participation too. One tap of the \"Forward\" key and someone who always saw herself as part of The Forces for Good (but who could never find the time to change the world) gets to enjoy that wonderfully warming self-righteous feeling that comes from Striking a Blow. All it takes is either a couple of pins and a bulletin board or e-mail capability and your good deed of the day is done and finished before the morning's first coffee has cooled. Would an anonymous, forwarded-a-million-times e-mail lie to you?

[Collected via e-mail, June 2009] A little background: Woolworths (South Africa), if you don't know already, is a very expensive clothing and supermarket outlet (they sell a typical R50 T-shirt for R150). My daughter and I had just finished lunch at a Woolies Cafe in Hyde Park, Johannesburg. Because both of us are such biscuit lovers, we decided to try the 'Woolies Cookie'. It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe. The waitress said with a small frown, 'I'm afraid not, but you can buy the recipe.' I asked how much, and she responded; 'Only two fifty - it's a great deal' I agreed to that, and told her to add it to my bill. Thirty days later, I got my Visa statement, and the Woolworths charge was R485. I looked at it again, and I remembered I had only spent R49.95 for two sandwiches and about R120 for a scarf. At the bottom of the statement, it said, 'Cookie Recipe - R250.00'. That was outrageous! I called Woolworths Accounting Department and told them the waitress had said it was 'two fifty', which clearly does not mean 'two hundred and fifty Rands' by any reasonable interpretation of the phrase. Woolworths refused to budge. They would not refund my money because according to them; 'What the waitress told you is not our problem. You have already seen the recipe. We absolutely will not refund your money. I explained to the Accounting Department lady the criminal statutes which govern fraud in the state of Gauteng. I threatened to report them to the Better Business Bureau and The Attorney General's office. I was basically told: Do what you want. Don't bother thinking of how you can get even, and don't bother trying to get any of your money back' I said, OK, you've got my R250, and now I'm going to have R250 worth of fun. I told her that I was going to see to it that every cookie lover in the world with an e-mail account gets a R250 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus for free. She replied, 'I wish you wouldn't do that.' I said, 'Well, perhaps you should have thought of that before you RIPPED ME OFF!' and slammed down the phone. So here it is! Please pass it on to everyone you can possibly think of. I paid R250 for this, and I don't want Woolworths to EVER make another cent from this recipe!

From those humble origins the company has grown into an international chain, now operating thousands of outlets in more than fifty countries.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "During its formative years, one of the ways Domino's sought to increase its market share among the U.S. pizza-buying public was to offer a guarantee on the speed of its delivery, thereby enticing consumers to order from Domino's in preference to one of its many competitors. That guarantee, which began in 1979, was \"30 minutes or it's free.\" Under that policy, customers won either way: They received pizzas that arrived within a half-hour of ordering, assuring them of hot, fresh product for their money, or they received pizzas that might not have been as hot or as fresh, but without charge. In 1993, in reaction to multi-million dollar settlements arising from car accidents involving its delivery drivers, Domino's ended its delivery guarantee. While the pizza maker never admitted its drivers drove unsafely in their efforts to beat the 30-minute deadline, at a 1993 news conference Domino's owner Thomas S. Monaghan said the guarantee was being dropped in an attempt to fight a \"public perception of reckless driving and irresponsibility.\" That perception was fueled by a couple of key lawsuits against Domino's. In 1992, the company agreed to pay $2.8 million to the family of an Indiana woman killed by one of its delivery people. The woman, 41-year-old Susan Noonan Wauchop of Calumet City, Illinois, died when a Domino's truck struck her van near the Indiana-Michigan border in 1990, an accident that also injured three of her sons and a friend. Domino's has always maintained that road and weather conditions, not the delivery time requirements, were the primary factors behind that crash. Yet it was a case ruled upon in 1993 that rang down the curtain on the \"30 minutes or it's free\" guarantee. An injury to a 49-year-old St. Louis, Missouri, woman, whose car was struck by a Domino's driver in 1989, led to an award of $750,000 in actual damages and $78 million in punitive damages against the pizza company. Jean Kinder, the injured driver, had suffered injuries to her head and back after the driver of the pizza delivery vehicle ran a red light and struck her vehicle. Available information indicates that Kinder did not receive the full $78,750,000 awarded to her but instead chose to settle for $15 million (with the local franchise holder ponying up $9 million and Domino's the other $6 million), but this information cannot be confirmed. A reason why she might have decided to accept this much smaller amount is because, had she not done so, the verdict would have been appealed, and large punitive awards granted by juries often don't survive the appeals process since appellate courts are free to reduce or even eliminate such awards. In Kinder's case, she might have felt that a $15 million bird in the hand was better than a $78 million one in the bush. Human nature being what it is, the accidents that resulted in the demise of the guarantee are now recalled in a way that better suits them to serve as fodder for an explanatory tale: The deceased 41-year-old woman and the severely injured 49-year-old woman are transformed into a small child, and their accidents (which involved vehicles colliding with other vehicles) become an instance of a pizza delivery driver running down a youngster who had been walking alongside the road or attempting to cross the street. In this way, the horrific is made even more horrific; the mind's eye is left contemplating the lifeless body of a little kid lying in the road. In this manner, the essence of the reason for the guarantee's having been rescinded becomes far easier to grasp than it does when stated in more nebulous terms of lawsuits settled out of court and open questions of who really was at fault. Domino's still offers its customers a guarantee that they will be satisfied with the product, but it is a quality guarantee rather than a time-dependent one. Says the company's Total Satisfaction Guarantee: \"If for any reason you are dissatisfied with your Domino's Pizza dining experience, we will re-make your pizza or refund your money.\" Barbara \"I'll tell them my dining companion was a poor conversationalist and demand a refund\" Mikkelson", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "", "Example": "When I was managing the local Domino's pizza (in Washington state) the rumor for why we dropped the \"30 minutes or less\" guarantee was that a driver was told to speed and get a pizza delivered on time by his manager and on that delivery he hit and killed a small child. I never really believed it, but it was a good story for explaining that we no longer had the guarantee. I was just speaking with a Domino's manager in Idaho and she said that this story is told \"like gospel\" in her store as well.", "Last Updated": "21 July 2014", "Credibility": "false", "URL": "www.snopes.com/business/consumer/dominos.asp", "Claim": "Domino's Pizza ended its \"30 minutes or it's free\" guarantee because a speeding delivery driver hit and killed a child.", "Claim_ID": "business_consumer_dominos", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/business/consumer/dominos.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "sg.answers.yahoo.com", "link": "https://sg.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20160118203006AASx4Xk", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.reddit.com", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1g9q5x/til_dominos_pizza_cancelled_their_30_minutes_or/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "downyupl4p.ga", "link": "http://downyupl4p.ga/dominos-pizza-delivery-driver-pay.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.quora.com", "link": "https://www.quora.com/Has-anyone-ever-received-free-pizza-because-it-wasnt-delivered-in-30-minutes", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino's_Pizza", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "deliverpizza.blogspot.com", "link": "http://deliverpizza.blogspot.com/2012/03/dominoes-pizza-delivery-driver.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.accountingweb.com", "link": "http://www.accountingweb.com/practice/growth/when-increased-productivity-leads-to-more-lawsuits-how-some-efficiency-initiatives", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "boards.straightdope.com", "link": "http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-593702.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "romug.com", "link": "http://romug.com/delivery-fee-dominos/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "tropical-flavors.ru", "link": "http://tropical-flavors.ru/files/2542-pizza-driver-killed-st-louis.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "gresoutensec1985.pen.io", "link": "http://gresoutensec1985.pen.io/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.fark.com", "link": "http://www.fark.com/comments/8755382/Man-tries-to-rob-Dominos-delivery-driver-fails-to-realize-modern-pizza-delivery-boy-usually-carries-a-gun", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.simpsonsarchive.com", "link": "http://www.simpsonsarchive.com/episodes/9F06.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.sjpba.net", "link": "http://www.sjpba.net/Farsider/061412.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "community.cartalk.com", "link": "http://community.cartalk.com/discussion/2306209/a-new-chevy-spark-with-everything-on-it-including-anchovies", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.washingtoninjuryattorneyblog.com", "link": "http://www.washingtoninjuryattorneyblog.com/spinal_cord_injury/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.wernervanrooyen.com", "link": "http://www.wernervanrooyen.com/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "rottenink.wordpress.com", "link": "https://rottenink.wordpress.com/tag/tv/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "blog.bigquizthing.com", "link": "http://blog.bigquizthing.com/2010_01_01_archive.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "github.com", "link": "https://github.com/robennals/think-link/blob/master/ruby/snopesclaims.csv", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "bizgetkb.tk", "link": "http://bizgetkb.tk/delivery-driver-taxes.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "hereyfilessgp.ga", "link": "http://hereyfilessgp.ga/requirements-to-be-a-pizza-delivery-driver.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "hitpcivendrivern5.gq", "link": "http://hitpcivendrivern5.gq/dominos-delivery-driver.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "coolwupqw6.gq", "link": "http://coolwupqw6.gq/dominos-delivery-driver-pay.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "pediaview.com", "link": "https://pediaview.com/openpedia/Domino's_Pizza", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "herekfiles1j.gq", "link": "http://herekfiles1j.gq/pizza-delivery-driver-age.html", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "On 16 January 2015, New York City-based British tea shop Tea & Sympathy published a Facebook status update castigating candy giant Hershey's, alleging the company had \"banned\" imports of Cadbury chocolates made in the United Kingdom. In addition, the post claimed popular imported British chocolate items including Yorkie bars and Toffee Crisps were \"banned\" because their names or likenesses were too similar to the American confectionaries York Peppermint Patties and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups:", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The post concluded by urging fans to contact the CEO of Hershey's to express their displeasure over the new restriction. On 23 January 2015, the New York Times published an article examining claims of a ban on the sale of Cadbury UK's chocolates in the United States (where they have a strong fan base, despite higher pricing than American versions). Partially at issue is whether Hershey's can \"ban\" imports or sales of any product. While Hershey's has a lock on a lot of the United States' chocolate market, the company technically doesn't have the authority to ban anything from the U.S. market as it is not a regulatory agency. However, Hershey's can enforce the license it has to manufacture Cadbury chocolates in the U.S. and claim UK-made versions of those products violate the terms of that licensing agreement. It's worth noting the status update above doesn't pertain to just Cadbury UK products. If the claim is accurate, the company additionally argued other imported British chocolate products (which are not licensed by Hershey's) could unfairly confuse consumers due to their resemblance to American chocolate brands. Cited in the Facebook update and Times article were Yorkie bars and Toffee Crisps and their alleged similarity to York Peppermint Patties and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, respectively: As the image displayed above shows, Yorkies are not patty-shaped (and neither are they mint candy), and the packaging colors bear no resemblance to York Peppermint Patties. Toffee Crisps are likewise not cup-shaped candies, though the color is similar (albeit not identical) to Reese's products. Clearly, both sides have an interest in swaying public sentiment. Hershey's stands to gain from consumers forced to purchase US-made Cadbury products, and smaller shops such as Tea & Sympathy serve a thriving market of anglophiles, expats, and other chocolate lovers who prefer UK formulations for a number of reasons. The Times reported the primary importer of affected products confirmed it would no longer be importing the following British products: As a result of a settlement with the Hershey's Company, Let's Buy British Imports, or L.B.B., agreed to stop importing all Cadbury's chocolate made overseas. The company also agreed to halt imports on KitKat bars made in Britain; Toffee Crisps, which, because of their orange packaging, and yellow-lined brown script, too closely resemble Reese's Peanut Butter Cups; Yorkie chocolate bars, which infringe on the York peppermint patty; and Ms. Perry's beloved Maltesers. Hershey's has been silent so far about the controversy despite vocal opposition. However, a spokesman for the company e-mailed the Times about the settlement and confirmed Hershey's wished to enforce its trademarks and limit or dispute the sale of certain imported chocolate brands: Jeff Beckman, a representative for Hershey's, said L.B.B. and others were importing products not intended for sale in the United States, infringing on its trademark and trade dress licensing. For example, Hershey's has a licensing agreement to manufacture Cadbury's chocolate in the United States with similar packaging used overseas, though with a different recipe. \"It is important for Hershey to protect its trademark rights and to prevent consumers from being confused or misled when they see a product name or product package that is confusingly similar to a Hershey name or trade dress,\" Mr. Beckman said in an email. So while Hershey's hasn't \"banned\" imports of chocolate from the UK, the company has confirmed a settlement that will result in the effective discontinuation of imports of some Cadbury brand chocolates and some other UK-made confectionaries. Enterprising fans of British chocolate should still be able to procure their favored treats, but doing so is set to become much more difficult.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/nyregion/after-a-deal-british-chocolates-wont-cross-the-pond.html;https://www.facebook.com/TeaAndSympathyNYC/posts/10155110984185650;", "Example": "[Collected via e-mail and Facebook, January 2015] Has the Hershey Chocolate Company really banned Cadbury Chocolate products from being imported to the United States?

Mine in Western Australia, expressing frustration at his inability to obtain replacement parts for the Nissan-manufactured bus used to transport staff to and from the mine. Using language in turn hilarious and coarse, Mr. Byrne describes how even the simplest parts (such as nuts and washers) have to be shipped from Japan, are grossly overpriced, and take several days to arrive and even then, they're likely as not to be the wrong parts. We were finally able to confirm this item as genuine in March 2005, when we heard from the missive's writer, Jarrod Byrne, who told us: This letter was indeed sent to Nissan Motor Co. The expletives were not originally part of the letter, but were added by some enterprising individual after the fact. Nissan did respond to the letter, with the opening line being \"Thanks for your correspondence Jarrod, it certainly got our attention\". Which was, after all, the entire purpose of writing it. (Quite quick on the uptake these Nissan people.) Bounty Gold mine closed in 2001, the letter, the issues and the people on the cc list are all real, as were my frustrations at the time. Mr. Byrne also informed us that Nissan began \"showing a greater level of interest and punctuality\" after receipt of his letter, but the Bounty Gold Mine had already budgeted for an alternative bus by then, and the Nissan bus was probably removed from service within the next six months.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "", "Example": "Jarrod Byrne Underground Maintenance Planner Bounty Gold Mine, Mt Holland Forrestania, Western Australia Tel (090) 394 527, Fax (090) 394 528 Nissan Motor Co (Australia) Pty.

Currently we have a Nissan W40 Civilian bus that we cannot use to transport staff to and from the mine. The reason this bus is not operational is not labour or condition related, it is because of a denial on the part of yourself and Nissan Motor Co to adequately supply your clientele with parts.

It stretches the bounds of credulity that items such as wheel nuts (a consumable in most of the known world) are available with a lead time of 4 days-ex east. What resoundingly snaps the bounds of credulity clean in half is that items such as brake shoes are ex Japan (6 weeks). I cannot deny the effectiveness of these components, they not only slow the bus down, they have the ability to stop it stone fucking dead for 6 weeks! I didn't even bother enquiring availability on such complicated parts such as washers etc. the only washers in stock would be Washer? Wind fuck out of this customer and tell him it's ex east. On the rare occasion we have been delivered parts within an acceptable time period, they have been entirely wrong. It is not that the wrong parts are ordered, it is that some of your parts interpreters are so green I couldn't set them on fire with petrol. These are not isolated incidents, they occur every time we try to purchase parts, from $10.00 hoses, at $109.40 each, through to internal gearbox components that are second only to thermonuclear warheads in their capacity to annihlate all that surrounds them. It is astounding that in this day of interstate air and road transport at least 6 times a day, you peanuts take 4 days to get a part across the country. May I suggest you stop freighting the parts with Nissan transport vehicles as the 3 week delay in Nissan's 24 hr roadside assist is becoming too much for us to bear. I could elaborate on the complete frustration I feel from trying to keep the bus on the road safely. Suffice to say the bus driver now has a firm belief in the afterlife and we haven't ruled out danger money for the position. Please don't get me wrong, I could handle the first 35 times of being fucked around, (the apologetic kiss from customer support was always welcome). Now that you've turned it into a bizarre form of sado-masochism complete with scratching and biting, I feel I have to complain... I look forward to discussing every single frustrating event of the past 8 months with you. I SINCERELY HOPE YOU CUNTS NEVER BUILD PLANES Yours in utter amazement, Jarrod Byrne CC.

technology that allows for the generation and mailing of identical pieces of correspondence to multiple recipients, with everything but a few specific pieces of information (e.g., name, address, salutation) reproduced from a template, has also allowed for the large-scale commission of some embarrassing slip-ups (either through accident or sabotage). One of the more legendary (if apocryphal) tales of this nature holds that a bank sent a mass-mailing to thousands of its best (i.e., richest) customers, each one headed with the salutation \" Dear Rich Bastard .\"", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "And automated or otherwise, the practice of periodically sending mail (such as Christmas cards) to persons with whom the correspondent is not in regular contact carries the potential for creating incidents both embarrassing and hurtful, as British MP Michael Brown noted in 2003: I used to send about 300 [Christmas] cards but now, with the ease of computer records and labels, some MPs can send in excess of 1,000. My agent would be smoothing ruffled feathers until March among those who had been overlooked. The general rule was that once admitted to the list, a card was always sent in subsequent years. But even this could cause embarrassment. Cards ended up being sent to \"Mr and Mrs\" when Mrs had passed away earlier in the year. All of these elements sadly came into play in January 2005, when a 15-year-old Sydney, Australia, boy whose mother had died suddenly fifteen months earlier received a back-to-school check from the state government addressed to \"Mrs Passed Away.\" The Sydney Daily Telegraph described the unfortunate family's reaction: The boy's father said his son, 15, initially thought the letter was a \"sick joke\", until he realised it was an official letter from Premier Bob Carr. \"This is nothing short of disgraceful,\" the boy's father said. \"All the work that's gone into helping my son since his mother died has gone down the drain.\" The boy's mother died 15 months ago, and her family is still trying to come to terms with her sudden death. The letter and the attached $50 cheque are both addressed to \"Mrs Passed Away\", and sent to the family's western Sydney address. \"We thought it was some type of sick joke until we opened the envelope to find Bob Carr's smiling melon on the letter,\" the father, who did not want to be named, said. \"He can keep his lousy $50. We don't want his cheque\". The father said he was dumbfounded at how such a callous bureaucratic bungle could slip through the system. \"We do something wrong by the Government and they're into us. As soon as they make a mistake you get a flippant apology,\" he said. The family received apologies from Director General of Education Dr. Andrew Cappie-Wood and Education Minister Carmel Tebbutt, but they failed to mollify the teen's grieving father, who proclaimed: \"The letter has Bob Carr big-noting himself. I want an apology from him.\" Follow-up news accounts indicated that New South Wales premier Bob Carr initially said he would not be issuing a personal apology because he did not address the letter, but in the end Mr. Carr did extend an apology (personal or otherwise): Mr. Carr said the incident was unfortunate, but the large number of cheques sent out by the government meant mistakes were possible. \"But of course, we apologize, and we apologize unreservedly.\" A similar snafu occurred in December 2008, when the U.S. Army issued an apology for sending relatives of soldiers killed overseas letters that addressed them with a rather impersonal salutation: The Army said that 7,000 family members of soldiers killed in the Iraq or Afghan wars mistakenly were sent letters addressing them as \"John Doe.\" Army Chief of Staff Gen. George W. Casey, Jr., was sending a personal letter to all the families who received the improperly addressed letters as the result of a printing error, the Army said. The letters, sent to relatives of all Army soldiers killed since the start of the Afghan and Iraq wars, described goods and services families are eligible to receive. But because of the error, the letters began with \"Dear John Doe.\" An Army spokesman said the error occurred because of a failure of a mail merge program, software used to personalize large mailings.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "", "Example": "", "Last Updated": "25 January 2009", "Credibility": "true", "URL": "www.snopes.com/business/consumer/passedaway.asp", "Claim": "A teenager whose mother had died received a government check mailed to \"Mrs. Passed Away.\"", "Claim_ID": "business_consumer_passedaway", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/business/consumer/passedaway.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/business/consumer/consumer.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.leakybooks.org", "link": "http://www.leakybooks.org/26zh3s_i-passed-as-a-teenager.pdf", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.realitytvworld.com", "link": "http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/note-draws-more-grief-instead-of-gratitude-1001507.php", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.upi.com", "link": "http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2005/01/19/Note-draws-more-grief-instead-of-gratitude/89781106172834/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "wewerethecoolkids.blogspot.com", "link": "http://wewerethecoolkids.blogspot.com/2007/07/blogathon-post-16-urban-legends-dominos.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "marquisdugalipot.blogspot.com", "link": "http://marquisdugalipot.blogspot.com/2009_01_01_archive.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.sjpba.net", "link": "http://www.sjpba.net/Farsider/030812.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "theanna.org", "link": "http://theanna.org/clip/january2005.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.newspapers.com", "link": "https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/34447227/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "", "link": "/aclk?sa=l&ai=CPofOMrGjVs2JLIyMpgPp8bWAD82EwNIFpcn_r4gBt8KrigIIAxABYOWDgICoFqABiciO6gPIAQGqBChP0EarEBdboljGh_s61Tc7dRF4NAGbPdyjDrksuGz-G1CbdoUVjss_gAfft_EVkAcDqAemvhvYBwE&sig=AOD64_3qbm6PGcV5o1KizyUvZsfxBEmeZg&clui=0&q=&ved=0ahUKEwjAkc70s8DKAhUGs4MKHcEED8YQ0QwITQ&adurl=http://www.opentohope.com/death-of-a-parent/", "link_type": "ads_main"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "oac.cdlib.org", "link": "http://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=ft600006bb;NAAN=13030&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=d0e1025&toc.id=d0e37426&brand=oac4", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.fold3.com", "link": "https://www.fold3.com/document/158194806/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "ufdc.ufl.edu", "link": "http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00027795/03461", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "Would you be mystified to come home to find your house had a new roof?

Thus, a lawyer becomes a \"mouthpiece,\" a pretty woman a \"doll\" or a \"skirt,\" and a well-muscled bouncer a \"gorilla.\" We delight in these dual uses because, in oddball fashion, these creative doublings seem to convey in a more vivid fashion the essences of the items at hand.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Thus, names of various foodstuffs are often employed as casual terms for money (a theme of sustenance, perhaps?): lettuce, cabbage, coconuts, and even bananas. We accept these slang terms as an ordinary part of the linguistic landscape, barely giving them a second thought. Yet sometimes that second thought is required, especially in the world of commerce. It was the use of \"banana\" in the monetary sense that caused $10,000 worth of trouble for a national chain of electronics stores. In 1986, Silo (a chain of home electronics stores) ran a television commercial in 23 markets nationwide, offering stereos for \"299 bananas.\" They never thought anyone would take them at their word; after all, \"banana\" is a widely accepted, if playful, term for greenbacks. Who could possibly mistake one for the other? Thirty-two customers held the retailer to its unwitting word they showed up bearing loads of the yellow fruit and demanding the store keep its end of the bargain. \"The ad said bananas, by golly, and so we had 32 buyers come to our Southcenter distribution point Saturday morning to exchange bananas for the stereos,\" Ed Altizer, Silo district manager, said. Each stereo was exchanged for $40 to $60 worth of bananas, and Silo took in a total of 11,000 bananas.

Because of the comparatively primitive states of the transportation and refrigeration industries back then, milk a highly perishable food item could not generally be transported over long distances efficiently, and therefore those who did not live sufficiently close to a dairy supply source (or keep their own cows) could not count on having regular access to safe, unspoiled milk.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The solution to this marketing roadblock was the development of evaporated milk, a product created through a process which greatly reduced the volume of whole milk by removing about 60% of its water content via evaporation and ensured it remained fit for consumption much longer than fresh milk by subjecting it to heat-treatment sterilization and sealing it into cans. The finished product could be transported over long distances much more easily than whole milk because it was considerably reduced in volume and weight and did not require refrigeration. By adding water to the contents of a can of evaporated milk, consumers could obtain a reasonable substitute for fresh, whole milk and be assured that the product was sanitary. (Although the terms \"evaporated milk\" and \"condensed milk\" are often used interchangeably, the latter term can refer to either of two very different products. Evaporated milk and unsweetened condensed milk are both products made by removing approximately 60% of the water from whole milk and sterilizing the remainder through heat-treatment. Sweetened condensed milk is produced by adding a good deal of sugar to milk prior to removing 60% of its water, producing a sticky, sweet mixture which does not need to be heat-sterilized [because the added sugar acts as a natural preservative] and which cannot be turned back into a drink similar to whole milk through the addition of water.) One of the pioneers of the evaporated milk business was a grocer from Kent, Washington, named Elbridge Amos Stuart, who in 1899 co-founded the Pacific Coast Condensed Milk Company, selling canned evaporated milk to prospectors heading north to the Yukon gold rush. Stuart's faith in the general marketability of evaporated milk was well-founded, and, as sales began to grow, legend has it that he stumbled across the now-famous name for his product while strolling through downtown Seattle. Spotting a display of \"Carnation\" cigars in a tobacconist's window, Stuart thought the brand name an odd one for a stogie but a good one for his own product, and thus began the association of canned evaporated milk with a red-and-white label bearing the name Carnation. Stuart was as concerned with the ingredients that went into his product as he was with the process of making it, and he maintained the firm belief that a steady supply of good-quality milk could be ensured only by obtaining it from healthy cows. To that end he furnished his suppliers with purebred bulls to help them breed better milk cows, and he eventually established his own breeding farm, known as Carnation Farm. Stuart's philosophy of \"contented cows give better milk\" is reflected in this ad copy from a 1909 Carnation Milk newspaper advertisement: The superior flavor of Carnation Milk is merely that of rich, whole milk, unusually delicious because of the favorable climatic conditions peculiar to the north Pacific coast, where Carnation Milk cows, healthy and contented, are pastured all the year. These conditions and the extreme care and promptness exercised in handling, cooling and sterilizing, combine to make Carnation Milk nutritious, safe and tempting to the delicate appetite. Evaporated milk soon became, as its founder had envisioned, as much a staple of grocery store shelves as salt or sugar. Although Carnation was far from the only brand of evaporated milk available (Borden's Eagle was a strong competitor), it has long been the market leader and best-known national brand of evaporated milk in America, and generations of Americans raised on it fondly recall the familiar sight of red-and-white Carnation cans in their kitchen cupboards. By the time it was bought up by Nestl S.A. in 1985, the Carnation company had grown from a producer of evaporated milk to a multi-billion-dollar conglomerate offering over 200 products, including market-leading brands in everything from tomato paste (Contadina) to pet food (Friskies). Such was the fame and ubiquity of Carnation Evaporated Milk in America that it became the subject of an affection expressed through humorous, satirical rhymes. Just a schoolkids of my own era (the 1960s) spun nonsensical riffs on popular songs, television theme music, and commercial jingles, so those of an earlier time delighted in inventing and repeating variations on a bawdy bit of verse about a familiar household product: Carnation milk is best of all; no teats to pull, no poop to haul. Got no nasty tail to switch; just poke a hole in the son-of-a-bitch!\" Summer, winter, spring or fall, Carnation milk is best of all; no tits to pull, no tails to switch, just punch a hole in the son of a bitch! Carnation milk is best of all, comes in cans both short and tall: No tits to pull, no hay to pitch; just punch two holes in the son-of-a-bitch. Carnation Milk is best in the land; it comes in a little red-and-white can. No tits to pull, no hay to pitch; just poke a hole in the son-of-a-bitch. Although catchy rhymes and consumer participation contests are methods which have been used by a number of companies over the years to promote their products (see our Burma-Shave page for a prime example), Carnation did not sponsor a contest inviting consumers to complete a rhyme beginning with the line \"Carnation Milk is best of all . . .\" which prompted the submission of the \"just poke a hole\" verse by a \"little lady from North Carolina\" who mailed it to Carnation and was rewarded with a $1,000 prize for her efforts. This piece is just a funny bit of doggerel fashioned about a common household product by a variety of anonymous jokesters decades ago which has since been dressed up with a framework presenting it as \"true story\" in a fashion similar to many other jokes -turned-urban-legend. Printed references to this verse indicate that it might be almost a century old itself. For example, the following presentation appears in a college literature textbook: Anonymous (American oral verse) CARNATION MILK (about 1900?) Carnation milk is the best in the land; Here I sit with a can in my hand - No tits to pull, no hay to pitch, You just punch a hole in the son of a bitch. \"This quatrain is imagined as the caption under a picture of a rugged-looking cowboy seated upon a bale of hay,\" notes William Harmon in his Oxford Book of American Light Verse (New York: Oxford UP, 1979).

Individuals, of course, feel free to let loose their inner practical joker on that day, but so do corporations and news outlets, as we detail in our article about memorable April Fools' Day pranks.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Radio stations in particular are known for their penchant for playing mean spirited April Fools' jokes on the public. At times this bent has served to land them in a spot of trouble, as appears to have been the case with a gag perpetrated by a radio station regarding its contest to win a Hummer. In late March 2005, listeners of KBDS in Bakersfield, CA, were told that whoever came up with the correct mileage accumulated that week by the station's two Hummer H2s as they were driven around town would win new Hummers from the station on April 1. Shannon Castillo was one of two listeners who guessed 103.9 miles, the right answer. (KBDS is also known as Play 103.9, so winning the contest was less a matter of figuring out the number of miles traveled by the trucks as it was an exercise in working out the response the radio station wanted to hear.) Castillo, who had hired a sitter to stay with her two children so that she could be at the station at 6 a.m. to pick up her prize, was chagrined to discover the \"Hummers\" she and another listener had won were not Hummer H2s, vehicles that cost approximately $60,000 each, but toy trucks. On 21 June 2005, she filed a lawsuit against the station for $60,000. Castillo's case came hard on the heels of another instance of a radio station's being embroiled in a lawsuit over a contest wherein listeners had been led to believe the prize being offered was substantially different from the one awarded. On 25 May 2005, Norreasha Gill was the 10th person to call Hot 102 (WLTO-FM) after \"DJ Slick\" (real name Jason Hamman) announced the station would be giving \"100 Grand\" to the tenth caller. While Gill did get her prize, it was not what she expected: instead of $100,000 in cash, she received a 100 Grand brand candy bar from the Lexington, KY, station. Gill sued Cumulus Media, Inc. for $100,000. Although the preceding suits might seem to lack legal sufficiency, a waitress at a Hooters restaurant in Panama City, Florida, was able to wring the value of the prize she had thought she'd won out of the company that had pulled what it described as an April Fools' joke. In 2001, 26-year-old Jodee Berry had bested the other servers at her restaurant in a competition to see who could sell the most beer in a month to that eatery's customers, with the winner to receive a new Toyota. When the day came for her to be presented with her prize, Berry was led blindfolded to the restaurant's parking lot to receive her award, but when the blindfold came off she was devastated to learn that the promised jackpot was not a Toyota automobile but rather a toy Yoda, a Star Wars doll. She quit her job and sued Gulf Coast Wings, Inc., the corporate owner of the restaurant, alleging breach of contract and fraudulent misrepresentation. In 2002 the suit was settled for an undisclosed amount of money, which one of the attorneys involved in the case said would enable her to go to the local car dealership and \"pick out whatever type of Toyota she wants.\" Whether the outcomes in the Hummer and \"100 Grand\" cases were similar is unknown, but one would have thought the \"toy Yoda\" suit would have served to give prank-minded radio stations pause.

This controversial ad showed a suburban teen preparing for school and wearing a number of Pepsi items, such as a T-shirt, a leather jacket, and sunglasses. As the items were depicted, words at the bottom of the screen revealed how many \"Pepsi Points\" they cost. The commercial concluded with the teen landing a Harrier jet near a bike rack at his school and the plane's searing jet stream stripping a teacher to his underwear. The smug teen says, \"Sure beats the bus,\" before the words \"Harrier Fighter: 7,000,000 Pepsi Points\" appeared on the screen. Enter John Leonard, then a 21-year-old business student. Upon seeing that commercial and discovering he could purchase individual Pepsi points from the company for 10 each, he set about to get himself a Harrier at an unbelievable bargain rate. On 28 March 1996, Leonard forked over 15 original points plus a check for $700,008.50 raised from five investors for the remaining 6,999,985 points \"plus shipping and handling\" and demanded his jet. Pepsi laughed off the claim, pointing out the Harrier had never been offered in the Pepsi Points catalogue and was just in the commercial to provide a humorous completion to the piece. \"If we have to put disclaimers on spots that are obviously farces, where does it end?\" Pepsi spokesman Jon Harris said. Well, it didn't end there. Leonard filed suit in Miami against Pepsi for breach of contract, fraud, deceptive and unfair trade practices, and misleading advertising. The issue then landed in federal court in Manhattan with Pepsi responding by asking the court for a declaratory judgment saying it did not have to give Leonard a Harrier. In August 1999, the New York judge upheld Pepsi's case. \"No objective person could reasonably have concluded that the commercial actually offered consumers a Harrier jet,\" U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said. Not that Leonard would have ended up with the full jet anyway if things had gone his way. The Pentagon quashed the promotion in September 1997 when it announced that these $33.8 million jets are not for sale in flyable shape. The Pentagon said any of the Marine aircraft would have to be \"demilitarized\" before being offered to the public (including disabling the Harriers' ability to take off and land vertically), which in this case would have meant both stripping them of their armaments and rendering them unable to fly.

millions of frequent-flyer airline miles as described in the widely-circulated e-mail quoted above. And yes, he really did purchase 12,150 cups of Healthy Choice chocolate pudding then donated them to the Salvation Army and two local food banks, earning himself a further tax deduction on the whole scheme.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "In May 1999 David spotted the promotion that was to bring him fame as \"the pudding guy.\" Consumers could buy 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 frequent flyer miles from the airline of their choice 1,000 miles if purchased by June 1. As described above, he did the math, and it was good. The rest is now history. Rarely does a straight news story pick up the sort of following this one did. By mid-February 2000, the text of a January 2000 news article about Phillips' escapade was spreading across the Internet, jumping from one inbox to the next. Society admires the 'clever fellow' who manages by dint of his acuity to get something for nothing (or at least something of great value for very little), and that was the case here. Since his story became public, Phillips has received a virtual ton of e-mail congratulating him on his scheme. Though most of this story's appeal comes from the image of the little guy screwing a big corporation, oddly enough, that's not what happened here. In January 2000, American Airlines awarded Phillips the last of 1.25 million free miles, with the balance coming from Northwest Airlines, Delta and United. Because the airlines sell the frequent-flyer miles to Healthy Choice for the promotion for about two cents a mile, they aren't out a thing. Healthy Choice likely also made on the deal, because the value of the publicity surrounding Phillips' pudding run probably exceeds the actual dollar cost incurred by the company for purchasing those miles. The Wall Street Journal quoted an official of Healthy Choice as saying the frequent-flier offer \"met and exceeded expectations,\" although the company's spokeswoman wouldn't discuss the promotion's sales figures or data about participants. Kudos to Healthy Choice for handling as professionally as it did what must have seemed a very strange situation. According to Phillips' oft-repeated account, one day the stacks of 500-free-miles certificates just began arriving no fanfare, and certainly no attempts on the part of the company to back away from the promotion. Those who still remain a tad skeptical about all of this are certainly excused; it's an improbable story, after all. A visit to the link in the additional information section below should settle any remaining doubts. To be found there is Phillips' account of the affair as well as a supporting photo record of the stacks of pudding and certificates received. The \"pudding miles\" have since been used up, but not before David Phillips, his wife, and their daughters undertook some enjoyable trips with the rewards of his scheme: The Phillips children, Katie and Emma, were 7 and 5 in 2000. And while the girls grew \"sick\" of all that pudding back then, they learned a thing or two about travel. \"They are real pros,\" Phillips said. \"Katie, who is 19 now, flew to Italy on her own last year, and our 16-year-old has flown to visit friends on the East Coast several times all on frequent flier miles, of course!\" As for Phillips and his wife, Cindy, their best trip took them to the island of Mauritius in the southwest Indian Ocean, flying first-class on British Airways. \"The best guy trip was when four of us went to Peru,\" David said. He described one of his best family vacations as a trip to Playa del Carmen on the Yucatan Peninsula, for his family, his parents and his sister. \"Amazingly, I was able to get seven free tickets to Mexico using frequent flier miles,\" he said. \"That's not so easy these days.\" As for those pudding miles, they are all gone, Phillips said. But not to worry. You may not score on frequent flier miles from Healthy Choice, but somewhere out there some other company is bound to miscalculate a promotion. Barbara \"pudding pop\" Mikkelson Sightings: The \"guy takes advantage of pudding promotion to earn airline miles for life\" concept features in the plot of the 2002 Adam Sandler film Punch-Drunk Love . Additional information: Photos of the pudding stacks", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.flyertalk.com/pudding.htm;http://us.imdb.com/Details?0272338;", "Example": "David Phillips, a civil engineer at UC-Davis, has become a cult hero in the obsessive subculture of people who collect frequent-flier miles by converting $3,150 worth of pudding into 1.2 million miles. Oh, yeah he's also going to claim an $815 tax write-off. Last May, Phillips was pushing his shopping cart down the frozen-food aisle of his local supermarket when a promotion on a Healthy Choice frozen entree caught his eye: He could earn 500 miles for every 10 Universal Product Codes (bar codes) from Healthy Choice products he sent to the company by Dec 31. Even better: Any Healthy Choice bar codes mailed by the end of the month would rack up double the mileage, or 1,000 miles for every 10 labels. \"I started doing the math, and I realized that this was a great deal,\" he said. \"I wanted to take my family to Europe this summer, and this could be the way.\" Frozen entrees were about $2 apiece, but a few aisles away Phillips found cans of Healthy Choice soups at 90 cents each. He filled his cart with them, and then headed to his local Grocery Outlet, a warehouse-style discount store. And there he hit the mother lode. \"They had individual servings of chocolate pudding for 25 cents apiece,\" he said. \"And each serving had its own bar code on it. I did some more math and decided to escalate my plans.\" Phillips cleaned the store out - bought every last cup of pudding in the warehouse. He then asked the manager for the addresses of all the other Grocery Outlet in the Central Valley and, with his mother-in-law riding shotgun in his van, spent a weekend scouring the shelves of every store from Davis to Fresno. \"There were 10 stores in all,\" he said. \"Luckily, most of them were right off the freeway.\" He filled his garage to the rafters with chocolate pudding and stacked additional cases in his living room. But Phillips wasn't finished yet - he had the manager of his local Grocery Outlet order him 60 more cases. \"A few days later I went out behind the store,\" he said, \"and there were two whole pallets of chocolate pudding with my name on them.\" All in all, he'd purchased 12,150 individual servings of pudding. Around this time, Phillips began to reveal his scheme to fellow of the Webflyer Web site where he posted an account under the name \"Pudding Guy.\" Phillips' tale was met with skepticism, if not outright disbelief, until he uploaded photos of his haul. But then Pudding Guy discovered he had a problem on his hands: The deadline for earning double miles was quickly approaching, and there was simply no way Phillips and his wife could tear off all those bar codes in time. \"I had to come up with something to do with all that pudding, fast\" he said. Phillips trucked the pudding to two local food banks and the Salvation Army, which agreed to tear off the bar codes in exchange for the food donation. \"We'd never seen anything like it,\" said Larry Hostetler, community relations director for the Sacramento Salvation Army. \"We've gotten some big donations, but always from companies and institutions, not individual people.\" Phillips got his bar codes in the mail in time to beat the deadline, and then held his breath. The promotion specifically said I could get the miles for any Healthy Choice product,\" he said. \"But still, it seemed like there was a good chance they'd get me on some technicality. \"But then packages large packages started arriving in the mail from Healthy Choice. In all, they contained 2,506 certificates, each good for 500 miles. That's 1,253,000 miles. Under the terms of the promotion, Phillips could have the mileage posted in any airline account. He split 216,000 between his United, Delta and Northwest accounts and posted the rest 1,037,000 miles to his American Airlines account. By surpassing the million-mile mark, Pudding Guy now has Aadvantage Gold status for life, entitling him to a special reservations number, priority boarding, upgrades and bonus miles. While we talked on the phone, Pudding Guy did a little math as you might have noticed by now, he's very, very good at math - and figured out that scheme netted him enough miles for 31 round-trip coach tickets to Europe, or 42 tickets to Hawaii, or 21 tickets to Australia, or 50 tickets anywhere in the U.S. \"Wow 31 trips to Europe for a little over $3,000,\" I said. \"That's less than $100 a ticket.\" \"Oh, it's better than that,\" Phillips said. \"Since I gave the pudding to charity I can take a tax write-off of $815. So that brings the cost of a ticket to Europe down to $75.\" As it turns out, Pudding Guy didn't donate all his stash to the food banks. He kept about 100 servings for himself, and he's just about finished them. \"Actually,\" he said, \"I really like the stuff.\"", "Last Updated": "9 March 2015", "Credibility": "true", "URL": "www.snopes.com/business/deals/pudding.asp", "Claim": "A clever consumer earned millions of miles of free air travel by taking advantage of a Healthy Choice pudding promotion.", "Claim_ID": "business_deals_pudding", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/business/deals/pudding.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/business/deals/deals.asp?print=y", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "fortune.com", "link": "http://fortune.com/2015/10/29/free-first-class-upgrades-tips/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "jacobcherians.blogspot.com", "link": "http://jacobcherians.blogspot.com/2011/08/pudding-guy.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6404563", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "gadling.com", "link": "http://gadling.com/tag/frequentfliermiles/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "gadling.com", "link": "http://gadling.com/tag/frequent-flyer/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "gadling.com", "link": "http://gadling.com/tag/frequent-flyer-miles/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.wisebread.com", "link": "http://www.wisebread.com/extreme-mileage-hacking-creative-ways-to-earn-flier-miles", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "www.cdmedics.eu", "link": "http://www.cdmedics.eu/constipationresearch/2482-constipation-and-nexium-weaning-baby-led/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "bonjourpeewee.blogspot.com", "link": "http://bonjourpeewee.blogspot.com/2006/11/awesome.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.facebook.com", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/Rubicoms/posts/783509888380120", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.oocities.org", "link": "http://www.oocities.org/pacfolly/page4", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.freemoneyfinance.com", "link": "http://www.freemoneyfinance.com/saving-money-2011/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.wopular.com", "link": "http://www.wopular.com/phillips-not-third-choice-gatland", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "semensperms.com", "link": "http://semensperms.com/tag/lsz/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.diseaseproof.com", "link": "http://www.diseaseproof.com/articles/healthy-food/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "inrng.com", "link": "http://inrng.com/2012/04/biocashflow-wristbands/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.agweb.com", "link": "http://www.agweb.com/blog/the_truth_about_trade/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.spendgo.com", "link": "http://www.spendgo.com/blog/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "miprinting.blogspot.com", "link": "http://miprinting.blogspot.com/2012_05_01_archive.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.greenhotels.com", "link": "http://www.greenhotels.com/newsletter.php", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.phonemicchart.com", "link": "http://www.phonemicchart.com/transcribe/biglist.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "underminers.org", "link": "http://underminers.org/the-book/chapter-7/chapter-7-part-3/", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "The history of corporate America is replete with examples (both real and apocryphal) of schemes to manipulate consumers into not only purchasing new products, but into buying more of the products they already use. Nearly everyone has heard the tale of the clever marketing man who doubled his company's sales of its shampoo product by adding the final word to the instructions \"Lather. Rinse. Repeat.\" Umpteen comedians have mused on the deliberate waste promoted by selling hot dogs in packs of eight, but buns in packages of twelve. And \"artificial obsolescence\" the yearly introduction of superficial stylistic changes in big-ticket items such as automobiles and appliances in order to lure status-conscious consumers into replacing perfectly functional products dates from the 1920s:", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "In the early 1960s, Alka-Seltzer , the venerable fizzy heartburn and acid indigestion pain-relief tablet, was in a fix similar to that of auto makers in the late 1920s. As exemplified by Speedy , the \"cartoon disk with a squeaky voice and pop eyes\" who had been introduced in the early days of television and by the 1960s was one of the corniest mascots still in use to sell an adult product, Alka-Seltzer had fallen out of favor with the younger segment of the drug-buying public. Alka-Seltzer's customers were mostly older folks, and the product was not attracting many new buyers among American youth, for whom it \"had become the symbol of people who drank too much and ate too much ... the unforgivable symbol of a slob, a hangover cure.\" Nor was the typical advertising of the era likely to appeal to them: Traditionally, pain-relief products had been advertised in gruesome commercials filled with horrors that would have given you pain if you didn't already have it. People ran around groaning, clutching their heads and stomachs, men and women crawled into corners and shrieked \"Pain! Pain! Pain!\" at television viewers who immediately turned off their sets. In one Frankensteinian commercial an ugly Neanderthal man went through a series of tortures, hammers dropped from the skies to pound his head, hoses appeared like snakes to whip him with water, straitjackets tied him up, you wanted to scream at him to \"get off my telly!\" People did not watch proprietary drug advertising unless they already had a headache or stomach problem and were looking for a quick fix, so most of the time, from the advertiser's point of view, advertising was like throwing money into a black hole.2 The creative minds at the (Jack) Tinker & Partners advertising think tank solved the problem by coming up with different reasons for people to take Alka-Seltzer and fashioning a series of entertaining commercials around those themes: [We] created the kickoff commercial that set the style for all the variety of commercials that followed. It was a truly wonderful, iconic commercial, an ovation to stomachs, a sweet-natured montage of big ones, little ones, slim ones, fat ones, all filmed at stomach level. There was a street digger's jackhammer stomach, a young chick's bare midriff, two men talking, facing each other, one with a flat stomach and one with a big round one, an array of stomachs presented with self-deprecating humor and sweet humanness to a happy, bouncy tune. \"No matter what shape your stomach's in\" was its opening phrase. Self-deprecating humor was new and popular in the sixties and unheard-of in drug commercials, when it appeared it was news. It was followed by 16 completely different commercials, each entertaining and stylish, each giving you a different reason to take Alka-Seltzer.2 One of these 16 commercials was based on an \" Alka-Seltzer on the Rocks\" theme, for which Tinker & Partners created \"a frothy, luminous commercial composed of nothing but two Alka-Seltzers dropping into a crystal glass of water.\" The key phrase here was \"two Alka-Seltzers\" up until this series of ads, both the Speedy commercials and Alka-Seltzer's packaging had promoted the use of but a single tablet at a time: We met an attractive doctor at Miles [Laboratories], Dorothy Carter, who demonstrated to us that in order for aspirin to break through the pain barrier it often required two aspirins, not one, to do the job. As aspirin is one of the ingredients that make Alka-Seltzer effective, we asked her if two Alka-Seltzers would be better than one. Yes, two would work better than one. But the directions on the package said to take only one. And all the old Speedy commercials demonstrated only one fizzing in water. [We] did a little dance with Dorothy Carter in the laboratory. What a stroke of good fortune that was! We changed the directions on the packages and began showing two Alka-Seltzers dropping into a glass of water in every commercial. Miles created portable foil packs that held two Alka-Seltzers each and sold them in new places, magazine stands, bars, fast-food restaurants, powder rooms they became ubiquitous and, naturally, Miles began selling twice as much Alka-Seltzer.2 Alka-Seltzer's sales didn't quite double, and not all of the increase was directly attributable to consumers' using two tablets instead of one, but Alka-Seltzer did experience a dramatic reversal of fortune due to the Tinker & Partners commercials and their emphasis on two tablets an emphasis that was later fortified with the catchy and enduring \"Plop, plop; fizz fizz\" jingle , which drove from the public consciousness any thought that anyone had ever used anything less than two Alka-Seltzers at a time. A common bit of trivia claims that Alka-Seltzer's famous \"Plop, plop; fizz, fizz\" jingle was written by the father of actress Julianna Margulies (of TV medical drama ER and The Good Wife fame). Although Julianna's father, Paul Margulies, was an advertising executive who helped create the \"Plop-plop, fizz-fizz, oh what a relief it is\" campaign for Alka-Seltzer , the jingle was actually

implementation of simple yet brilliant innovations that increase the profits of successful companies many times over everything from the mostly true ( Alka-Seltzer 's ad campaigns featuring the use of two tablets instead of one) to the completely apocryphal (an outsider's selling Coca-Cola the idea that they should bottle their product).", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Another prominent entry in this genre of marketing legends is the claim that instant cake mixes which required only the addition of water initially sold quite poorly because housewives felt \"guilty\" about contributing virtually nothing to the cake-making process a stumbling block that was successfully overcome when one food company hit on the ingenious idea of eliminating dried eggs from its mix and instead requiring the addition of a fresh egg, thus assuaging homemakers' guilt by providing them with a greater sense of participatory investment in the results. Although there's a grain of truth to this claim, the legend that sprouted from it is a different kind of fruit: a marketing innovation did revive flagging sales of cake mixes, but it wasn't the innovation most people think it was. First of all, the choice between offering \"complete\" cake mixes (i.e., mixes that included dried eggs, to which consumers added only water) or mixes that required the addition of fresh eggs was not an issue considered by food companies only when initial sales of instant cake mixes proved disappointing; it was a point of contention from the very beginning: When Pillsbury and the other big companies were working to develop their cake mixes in the 1940s, the question of whether or not to include dried eggs was a major in-house debate. Paul Gerot, the CEO at Pillsbury in this period, called it \"the hottest controversy we had over the product,\" and he noted that even after the mixes made their debut, the arguing went on for years. It's also not the case that initial sales of cake mixes were disappointing: between 1947 (just before the major food companies introduced their cake mix products to the market) and 1953, sales of cake mixes doubled. The problem occurred several years later, when sales of cake mixes flattened between 1956 and 1960 (rising only 5 percent during that period). It was then that the major food companies sought to find out why more families weren't using cake mixes and brought about the circumstances that gave rise to the \"egg theory\": Looking for reasons why so many women who could benefit from cake mixes seemed to be ignoring them ... Ernest Dichter [came up with an] analysis in the course of a study he was carrying out for General Mills. After interviewing women and exploring the emotions that surrounded cakes and baking, Dichter reported that the very simplicity of mixes just add water and stir made women feel self-indulgent for using them. There wasn't enough work involved. In order to enjoy the emotional rewards of presenting a homemade cake, they had to be persuaded that they had really baked it, and such an illusion was impossible to maintain if they did virtually nothing. \"This is typical of what the average housewife said: 'Yes, I'm using a cake mix; it saves me a lot of trouble but I really shouldn't,'\" Dichter wrote later. His advice was to leave the homemaker something to do for instance, add the eggs whenever she made a cake from a mix. She would feel she had contributed something of herself, and the mindless nature of the task would no longer plague her. According to Dichter, his client and, by implication, the other manufacturers seized on this wisdom and promptly reformulated their mixes, leaving out the dried eggs. Women started adding their own fresh eggs, stopped feeling guilty, and cake mixes became a success. Over the years this story came to be a favorite among other consumer experts, who often rounded up more psychological studies to reinforce Dichter's analysis. The egg theory, with its emphasis on the homemaker's personal investment in the cake, set the tone for much subsequent advertising (\"You and Ann Pillsbury can make a great team\") and has been widely acknowledged as the insight that saved cake mixes. However, as Laura Shapiro observed in Something from the Oven: Reinventing Dinner in 1950s America , \"while Dichter's work was influential, its precise role in the success of the cake mix is unclear.\" For starters, although it may not have been a point articulated by the homemakers Dichter surveyed, the fact was that fresh eggs produced superior cakes. Using complete mixes which included dried eggs resulted in cakes that stuck to the pan, had poor texture, had a shorter shelf life, and often tasted too strongly of eggs. \"Chances are,\" Shapiro wrote, \"if adding eggs persuaded some women to overcome their aversion to cake mixes, it was at least partly because fresh eggs made for better cakes.\" Furthermore, the two food companies who came to dominate the cake mix market in this era, General Mills and Pillsbury, adopted opposite approaches: the former chose to go with fresh-egg mixes, while Pillsbury opted to offer complete mixes. If the form of eggs used were truly the tipping point that saved the cake mix industry, then sales of one of these company's products should have tanked in comparison to the other's. The key marketing innovation that Dichter's analysis spurred was not the fresh-egg cake mix, but rather the repositioning of cakes as merely one element of a larger product, an overall creation that entailed a much greater degree of participation and creativity from homemakers and emphasized appearance over taste: Dichter rightly perceived the overwhelming weight of the moral and emotional imperative to bake cakes from scratch. His research spurred countless ads and magazine articles aimed at persuading women to differentiate between the plain cake layers \"merely step number one,\" according to Living and the finished masterpiece. \"Now, success in cakemaking is packaged right along with the precision ingredients,\" Myrna Johnston assured readers of Better Homes & Gardens in 1953. \"You can put your effort into glorifying your cake with frosting, dreaming up an exciting trim that puts your own label on it.\" For modern women, these authorities proclaimed, the real art of baking began after the cake emerged from the oven. This perspective changed the nature of the traditional challenges facing home bakers. Flavor and texture were no longer at issue, and they had little importance anyway in a cake that was destined for a great deal of imaginative frosting. Cover a quick angel food cake with apricot glaze and icing, and surround it with ladyfingers cut to size, the experts suggested. Or split the cake, fill it with buttercream, border it with chocolate, and top it with chocolate-dipped cherries. Fill and frost layers of yellow cake with butterscotch pudding, dot the top with salted pecans, and call it a torte. Cover an oblong cake with chocolate frosting and sprinkle it with green decorating sugar that's the football field. Use white frosting for the lines, and stick candy for the goalposts. A piece of banana covered with melted chocolate is the football. Cut a hole in the center of an angel food cake, fill it with partially jelled orange gelatin and canned peaches, frost the whole thing with whipped cream, and cover that with toasted coconut. McCall's gave directions for making a Humpty-Dumpty cake there were thirteen steps to it, including making three different frostings, painting the cake with food coloring, and assembling the various parts with wooden skewers and drinking straws. It took about twelve hours, though much of the time was spent waiting for various layers to dry. The thirteen steps didn't include making the cake itself from two boxes of mix. A huge, lavishly frosted layer cake, opened up wide so the viewer could gaze at the tenderness inside, became the presiding image in cake iconography. Ads for flour and cake mix, as well as for baking powder, shortening, chocolate, and coconut invariably displayed a cake in this posture. Like models, whose mesmerizing inescapable faces define beauty in their time, these cakes set the standard for perfect festivity and made most others look humble by comparison. The standard itself was purely visual. Flavor would never count for much in an industrially produced cake, because simple sweetness was so easily achieved in the factory and so widely acceptable. But the distinguishing attributes of the iconic cake its height and lightness were just the qualities that technology could achieve with ease. What ultimately ensured the long-term success of instant cake mixes was a declining exposure to the art of cooking. From the 1950's onward, middle class girls tended to spend more time engaged in other pursuits outside the kitchen (especially after the advent of television), many home economics courses offered at schools started teaching students to bake with mixes rather than from scratch, and culinary knowledge and skills acquired by mothers and grandmothers stopped being passed along to successive generations. As fewer and fewer home cooks learned to recognize the difference between from-scratch cakes and mix cakes, the longevity of the latter was assured.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932940021?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0932940021;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670871540?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0670871540;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/007016780X?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=007016780X;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765808943?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0765808943;", "Example": "A food processing firm marketed a cake mix which required that the housewife add only water to produce a creamy batter and fine cake.

According to the jape, a mercenary wife extracted the last bit of earning power from her dead husband by wheeling him into work at Boeing and leaving him there for the final week required for him to be eligible for his bonus.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Although clever wives are not fiction, this story is. There was no such deceased contract worker, nor was the account of the man's final week on the job a news story that ran in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . Possibly its anonymous writer intended the piece as a humorous take on what is sometimes perceived as the basis of how contract workers are compensated, that they are paid for their time on the job, not for what they do there. The anonymous hoaxster did make an effort to dress out his offering about a dead contractor being wheeled in his casket into work at Boeing and left there for a week with the appearance of credibility. Seemingly appropriate names were included in the hoax to make the leg-pull appear more believable. First, the airplane manufacturer does have a sizeable facility in Renton, Washington. Second, James Wallace is the Seattle Post-Intelligencer's aerospace reporter and, as such, his would be the most appropriate name to list as the author of any newspaper article about Boeing. (The real James Wallace of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer did not write this piece though, as he himself told us when we called him.) Also, the fake news story claims Randy Saseler is Boeing's vice president of engineering. While Boeing has a number of vice presidents of engineering (one per division, it seems), none of them bears that name. They do employ a Randy Baseler as their vice president of marketing. Possibly the unknown prankster drew his inspiration from a June 2000 Conseco television commercial. The ad shows an unmoving man wearing sunglasses seated at a desk. Throughout the day various assignments are placed on his desk and then picked up, completed, and dropped back at his desk by co-workers. At the end of the day the wife appears to pick him up. She is complimented on her husband s diligence and performance, shoos the appreciative co-worker away, closes the door to her husband's office, and begins to prepare him to leave. The voice-over on the commercial comments on how it's important to be prepared for the unexpected, leaving behind the unstated message that otherwise you too might have to day after day prop your dead husband at his desk at work to keep those paychecks coming in. The fake story about the deceased contract worker echoes another yarn from 2000 about a proof reader found dead at his desk after five days. Though the sad tale about George Turklebaum was repeated as true in a few newspapers, it too was fiction. Barbara \"dead reckoned\" Mikkelson Sightings: A couple of our readers recall viewing a somewhat similar skit on the television sit-com Not the Nine O'Clock News . In it, a union representative appealed for overtime pay and a promotion for the dead worker who, having been strapped to a heating radiator by his desk, had \"been available for duty 24 hours a day for the last month.\"", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "", "Example": "Aerospace Notebook: Dead Contractor Reports to Work By JAMES WALLACE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER REPORTER Contractors: A dedicated group of Engineers that circle the country seeking the next high paying job. Contractors rarely if ever receive pay for time not worked. They usually have very few benefits although some receive incentives such as holiday pay, Per Diem, and longevity bonuses. Diem is a daily tax free living expense paid to the contractor. Longevity Bonus is usually one weeks pay or other amount paid after an established period of time, normally on completion of one year... Contractors are known for showing up for work sick and /or injured in order to collect the incentives that they depend on, or to get paid for overtime, which is one and a half times their hourly pay. Boeing hasdocumented many instances where contractors have gone through extreme lengths in order to show up for work. \"We have seen people do extraordinary things before, but nothing like this,\" said Randy Saseler, Boeing's vice president of engineering. \"I am sure this is a first.\" Contractor shows up to work dead. At 5:00AMSaturday morning (Jan. 29) Wanda Robertson, the wife of contractor Peter Robertson, rolled her dead husband into a Renton, WA, Boeing facility, using the dead man's badge in order to gain entrance. She entered the building before most staff show up for work. \"I thought it was some kind of a joke,\" said former co-worker David Palmer. \"That coffin was in the corner for about a week; we thought the company was setting up some sort of show. We just ignored it. Geez that was Peter?\" Mrs. Robinson is facing charges of trespassing on Boeing property. According to a statement she filed with Renton police, Mr. Robertson was 1 week shy of collecting his longevity bonus; he would also have forfeited his Per Diem payment. Mrs. Robertson said that since he was physically at work, Boeing must pay him. \"The kids and I really need that money.\" \"We are educating ourselves about the legal aspects of this case. We have never had a case where a dead man continued to come to work. This is highly unusual. Obviously this woman is in need. We are considering paying her the money her husband would have received, as well as her husband's burial costs. We will however, add a clause in our contracts so that this does not happen again,\" Tim Clark, Boeing spokesman, recently told the industry publication Flight International magazine. \"We just do not

\"space pen\" anecdote about NASA's spending a small fortune to develop a ballpoint pen that astronauts could use in outer space, while completely overlooking the simple and elegant solution adopted by the Soviet space program (give cosmonauts pencils instead), is a valid one: sometimes we expend a great deal of time, effort, and money to create a \"high-tech\" solution to a problem, when a perfectly good, cheap, and simple answer is right before our eyes.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "As good a story and moral as that may be, however, this anecdote doesn't offer a real-life example of that syndrome. Both U.S. astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts initially used pencils on space flights, but those writing instruments were not ideal: pencil tips can flake and break off, and having such objects floating around space capsules in near-zero gravity posed a potential harm to astronauts and equipment. (As well, after the fatal Apollo 1 fire in 1967, NASA was anxious to avoid having astronauts carry flammable objects such as pencils onboard with them.) When the solution of providing astronauts with a ballpoint pen that would work under weightless conditions and extreme temperatures came about, though, it wasn't because NASA had thrown hundreds of thousands of dollars (inflated to $12 billion in the latest iterations of this tale) in research and development money at the problem. The \"space pen\" that has since become famous through its use by astronauts was developed independently by Paul C. Fisher of the Fisher Pen Co., who spent his own money on the project and, once he perfected his AG-7 \"Anti-Gravity\" Space Pen, offered it to NASA. After that agency tested and approved the pen's suitability for use in space flights, they purchased a number of the instruments from Fisher for a modest price. This is how Fisher themselves described the development of their Space Pen: NASA never asked Paul C. Fisher to produce a pen. When the astronauts began to fly, like the Russians, they used pencils, but the leads sometimes broke and became a hazard by floating in the [capsule's] atmosphere where there was no gravity. They could float into an eye or nose or cause a short in an electrical device. In addition, both the lead and the wood of the pencil could burn rapidly in the pure oxygen atmosphere. Paul Fisher realized the astronauts needed a safer and more dependable writing instrument, so in July 1965 he developed the pressurized ball pen, with its ink enclosed in a sealed, pressurized ink cartridge. Fisher sent the first samples to Dr. Robert Gilruth, Director of the Houston Space Center. The pens were all metal except for the ink, which had a flash point above 200 C. The sample Space Pens were thoroughly tested by NASA. They passed all the tests and have been used ever since on all manned space flights, American and Russian. All research and development costs were paid by Paul Fisher. No development costs have ever been charged to the government. Because of the fire in Apollo 1, in which three Astronauts died, NASA required a writing instrument that would not burn in a 100% oxygen atmosphere. It also had to work in the extreme conditions of outer space: In a vacuum. With no gravity. In hot temperatures of +150 C in sunlight and also in thecold shadows of space where the temperatures drop to -120 C(NASA tested the pressurized Space Pens at -50 C, but because of the residential [sic] heat in the pen it also writes for many minutes in the cold shadows.) Fisher spent over one million dollars in trying to perfect the ball point pen before he made his first successful pressurized pens in 1965. Samples were immediately sent to Dr. Robert Gilruth, Manager of the Houston Space Center, where they were thoroughly tested and approved for use in Space in September 1965. In December 1967 he sold 400 Fisher Space Pens to NASA for $2.95 each. Lead pencils were used on all Mercury and Gemini space flights and all Russian space flights prior to 1968. Fisher Space Pens are more dependable than lead pencils and cannot create the hazard of a broken piece of lead floating through the gravity-less atmosphere. Paul Fisher continues to market his space pens as the writing instrument that went to the moon and has spun off this effort into a separate corporation, the Fisher Space Pen Co.: Sightings: This legend was referenced in an episode of NBC's The West Wing TV series (\"We Killed Yamamoto\"; original air date 15 May 2002): Additional information: The Fisher Space Pen", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.thewritersedge.com/fisher.astronaut.cfm;http://www.thewritersedge.com/fisher.astronaut.cfm;http://www.spacepen.com/;", "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, May 2013] Ball-Point Pens for the Astronauts When NASA started sending astronauts into space, they quickly Discovered that ball-point pens would not work in zero Gravity.

The Russians used a pencil. Your taxes are due again enjoy paying them. [Collected on the Internet, 1999] Thought for the day. During the space race back in the 1960's, NASA was faced with a major problem. The astronaut needed a pen that would write in the vacuum of space. NASA went to work. At a cost of $1.5 million they developed the \"Astronaut Pen\". Some of you may remember. It enjoyed minor success on the commercial market. The Russians were faced with the same dilemma. They used a pencil. [The Moscow Times, 2000] There is a charming anecdote that roams from e-mail box to e-mail box around the world about how, at the height of the space race, the Americans and Soviets approached the same problem: how an astronaut (or cosmonaut) could use a pen to write in zero gravity. As the story goes, the Americans spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on an ambitious, gravity-immune ballpoint pen; they successfully developed such a pen; and this pen went on to become a massive commercial success in the private sector.

(The USA was the primary market, however, since it emerged from the war with a robust economy and had no damaged infrastructure to rebuild.) The phrase \"Made in Japan\" came to symbolize cheap, shoddy goods to Americans, and eventually the rumor arose that Japan had sought to avoid this stigma by deviously renaming one of its towns \"Usa\" so it could identify its products as being \"Made in USA.\"", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "This rumor was almost certainly a tongue-in-cheek joke inspired by someone's noticing the coincidence of a town in Japan named Usa (and perhaps fueled by American xenophobia or lingering resentment of the Japanese). In fact, the Japanese city of Usa (on the island of Kyushu) was not created by renaming an existing town; it was called Usa long before World War II. As well, nearly every country that imports goods requires them to be marked with the name of their country of origin, not a town or city, and it would have taken some circuitous (and probably expensive) routing to get goods marked \"Made in USA\" into other countries without anyone's noticing that they had originated in Japan. America, especially, Japan's largest market by far, would certainly have noticed the incongruity of goods marked \"Made in USA\" being imported into the USA. Of course, the idea that the U.S. Customs Department would simply shrug at Japanese products marked \"Made in USA,\" despite the confusion they would obviously cause, simply because they were \"legitimately\" identified as coming from the Japanese city of Usa is just silly. Lest anyone think that U.S. Customs inspectors were lax about enforcing the rules or willing to look the other way, consider the following difficulty Sony experienced with them as late as 1969 when Sony tried to downplay the fact that its products were Japanese in origin: . . . despite the Japanese flag flying on Fifth Avenue, most consumers, including actual customers, remained unaware that Sony was a Japanese company. Morita [President of Sony Sales] was uneasy about the possibility of a negative reaction, and did what he could to sustain the misapprehension. The required \"Made in Japan\" label, for example, was positioned on the product as inconspicuously as possible, in the smallest permissible size; and more than once, Sony edged below the minimum, causing U.S. Customs inspectors to turn back shipments. A notable exception to the USA's import laws is the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, which is allowed to use the \"Made in USA\" label on their products and export them to the USA duty-free. Legislation was introduced in Congress to close this loophole (also known as the \" Saipan Scam \") in 1999, but it died in committee.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links":

{"Origins": "In April 2004, a collection of about 100 biscuit tins accumulated by West Country aristocrat Count de Salis was put up for auction in the UK by Lawrences Auctioneers. One item of especial interest from this collection was a tin produced by biscuit makers Huntley and Palmers, renowned for their elaborate biscuit packaging \"to the extent that the tin lids were designed to be displayed on kitchen walls.\" The tin of interest came with a lid featuring an illustration of an Edwardian garden party based on a painting by 19th century children's illustrator Kate Greenaway.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "What made this one tin particularly noteworthy was that the illustration on its lid included some background details most definitely not suitable for children: a jam jar bearing a label with a vulgar four-letter word for excrement, an image of two dogs copulating, and an image of two naked lovers engaging in some \"splendor in the grass\": According to news accounts, the tins with the risqu lid illustration had first been issued around 1980, but the naughty details remained unnoticed until a shopkeeper finally spotted them with a magnifying glass years later; by the time Huntley and Palmers ceased production of tins using that design, thousands of them had already been sold. How did those scabrous images come to be part of the biscuit tin artwork in the first place? The proffered explanation was a familiar one it was a final act of revenge undertaken by a disgruntled, sacked employee: Richard Gold, of Lawrences Auctioneers, said: \"The employee was a draughts man who was fired but not given any financial help. He thought, 'I'll fix them,' so he produced this nice-looking tin and added these touches of his own.\" The tin was produced at a time of strained industrial relations at Huntley and Palmers, which at its height at the turn of the 20th century was the biggest biscuit producer in the world. The firm, which at one time had more than 5,000 employees at its complex in Reading, Berkshire, had supplied its brands to 137 countries. At the time of the X-rated tin's production, it had been forced to close its original plant in Reading in 1976 and was trying to cut costs at its production centre in Liverpool, so many workers were made redundant, including the rebel draughtsman. He may also have had other grounds for his actions, as the company was notorious for the strict rules it imposed on employees, with smoking in the toilet and stealing biscuits deemed sackable offences. Conduct was monitored even outside the factory gate, with a rule book from 1970 banning workers from throwing snowballs in the streets around the factory. We're a bit skeptical of this explanation, as most instances we've encountered of corporate shenanigans being attributed to disgruntled, revenge-seeking former employees actually turned out to be impish pranks carried out by non-disgruntled, non-vengeful current employees who allowed their penchants for levity to get the better of their senses of professional decorum. But regardless of how the salacious details came to be part of the titillating tin's artwork, they were, as a Huntley and Palmers spokesman said, \"a funny example of what happens when things go wrong

Magazine reports an interesting case of high-tech graffiti. It seems that a couple of Intel engineers working on the design of a recent version of the Pentium microprocessor included a message that describes their feelings about Bill Gates, president of Microsoft, a good corporate pal of Intel's. When a portion of the Pentium chip is examined under a powerful scanning electron microscope, the phrase \"bill sux\" is clearly visible, etched into the surface of the chip. The \"flaw\" in the chip was only discovered by accident well after the chip was released into the market, too late for Intel to prevent the chip from being used in the manufacture of tens of thousands of PCs. Intel says that both engineers responsible were former employees of Motorola, makers of the chips that are the heart of the Apple Macintosh. Both engineers have since been fired by Intel. It's a clever prank playing off the idea that a couple of Apple aficionados could surreptitiously sneak an anti-Bill Gates message onto the world's most popular CPU, where it could be seen only through a powerful microscope, but it's a hoax. Time ran no such article, there is no news bureau called \"API\" (a fictitious combination of AP and UPI, and the industry abbreviation for \"Application Programming Interface\"), and Intel denies that anyone was fired.

Born in Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania (just north of Pittsburgh) in 1844, young Henry was selling surplus foodstuffs from his mother's garden at the age of 8, and by the time he turned 12 he was working his own 3 -acre plot of land. Although Heinz was a bricklayer by profession (starting out in his father's brickyard and then moving on to operate his own brick factory), he was also a local purveyor of bottled horseradish. The pungent spice was valued both as an appetite-sharpening condiment and for its medicinal qualities, but it was available only in root form, and its preparation required tedious and time-consuming grinding in the kitchen. Anticipating the nascent processed food market, Heinz went door-to-door peddling ready-to-use horseradish, packaged in clear glass bottles to demonstrate its lack of fillers and impurities.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "In 1869 Heinz opted to forego the brick trade in favor of concentrating exclusively on the food business, expanding the product line to include pickles, vinegar, and celery as he built up the Anchor Pickle and Vinegar Works with partner L. C. Noble . The company grew \"with a rapidity seldom witnessed,\" moving to Pittsburgh and becoming Heinz, Noble & Company in 1872 when E.J. Noble joined the fold, and opening branch distribution houses in St. Louis and Chicago. After this promising beginning, however, a combination of financial problems brought about by the Panic of 1873 and a price-depressing surplus of agricultural products drove the firm into bankruptcy by 1875. With financial assistance from his brother, John, and his cousin, Frederick, Henry Heinz was back in business as F. & J. Heinz in 1876, the landmark year in which they introduced the product now most famously associated with Heinz: tomato ketchup. The Heinz product line continued to expand, adding products such as apple butter, pepper sauce, and mince meat, and in 1890 H. J. Heinz (as the company was known after Heinz acquired controlling interest from his brother in 1888) opened a plant in Allegheny City (now Pittsburgh's North Side). In one of the greatest advertising coups in history, Heinz attracted a flood of visitors to the Heinz Company Exhibit at the 1893 World's Columbia Exposition in Chicago by distributing cards promising attendees who stopped by a free souvenir: a 1 -inch pickle-shaped watch charm emblazoned with the name \"Heinz.\" So successful was this gambit that the New York Times reported afterwards: It has just been discovered that the gallery floor of the Agricultural Building has sagged where the pickle display of the H. J. Heinz Company stood, owing to the vast crowd which constantly thronged their stand to taste their goods or procure a watch charm. But greater things were yet to come. It was in 1896 that Henry Heinz came up with one of the most recognized slogans in advertising history: \"57 Varieties.\" This catch phrase had nothing to do with the actual number of varieties produced by H. J. Heinz , though, which by then totaled over 60 (including plum pudding, strawberry preserve, India relish, olive oil, spaghetti, euchred pickle, currant jelly, chili sauce, peanut butter, and celery soup). Rather, Heinz was riding an elevated train in New York when he spied an advertising placard in the train car promoting \"21 styles\" of shoes; struck by the concept, and recognizing that catchiness and resonance were far more important qualities for a company slogan than literal accuracy, Heinz cast about for the perfect number to use for his own company's version of the phrase. Settling on fifty-seven, Heinz soon put the number to work, and within a week the sign of the green Heinz pickle bearing the words \"57 Varieties\" was everywhere Heinz \"could find a place to stick it.\" He soon ordered the construction of a six-story, twelve-hundred-light display featuring a forty-foot pickle; installed at the intersection of 5th Avenue and 23rd Street in New York City, this electric marvel dazzled New York residents and tourists until 1906. By the time the H. J. Heinz company celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1969 its product line included more than 1,100 items, but over the years the number 57 had permeated almost every aspect of the Heinz corporate culture. Besides being a company slogan, it appeared in the name of one of their best-selling products ( Heinz 57 steak sauce), their mailing address ( P.O. Box 57 ), and their phone number ( 273-5757 ). Yankee great Joe DiMaggio reportedly lost out on a $10,000 promotional deal with Heinz when his major-league record hitting streak ended at 56 games in July 1941 (he later claimed that the Heinz deal was \"just talk\"), up until the 1950s anyone who wrote to Heinz about an upcoming 57th birthday received a free case of Heinz products, and in 2001 Heinz paid $57 million to have the new home of the Pittsburgh Steelers football team dubbed Heinz Field.

The Padres' new digs were named for their corporate sponsor, the PETCO chain of pet stores, vendors of pets and pet supplies at over 650 outlets in 43 states. PETCO purchased the naming rights to the Padres' new stadium for $60 million.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "As has been done with many other public structures, a program was initiated at PETCO Park to raise revenue by allowing people to purchase personalized bricks inscribed with messages of their choosing. The personalized bricks are put on permanent display in the stadium's Palm Court Plaza. The Ballpark Brick Program at PETCO Park presented an interesting opportunity for the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ), who had written letters to Padres executives asking them to cancel the naming rights agreement. PETA has long been urging consumers to boycott the PETCO chain on the grounds that numerous complaints have reported PETCO stores as all too often being the site of sick, dying, and mistreated animals: PETA's national campaign against PETCO was launched in order to inform consumers of the pet-shop chain's bad habit of leaving animals sick and dying in its stores, pending lawsuits, and angry customers. PETA is sending monthly casualty reports to PETCO officials, citing dozens of eyewitness accounts of sick and dying animals at PETCO stores across the country. During March [2004] alone, PETA received 59 complaints from 55 PETCO stores in 21 states. The reports can be read at PETCOCruelty.com. PETA has also filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging that PETCO failed to disclose animal deaths, customer complaints, and legal actions filed against the company (including lawsuits over cruelty to animals in San Francisco and Utah) to its stockholders. And PETA has filed a shareholder resolution calling on PETCO to end its sales of animals. Although they may have failed at prevailing upon the Padres to change the name of their ballpark, purchasing a brick inscribed with an anti-PETCO message at PETCO Park would be a subversive way for PETA to take the battle to the enemy, so to speak, and that's exactly what they attempted to do. However, Christy Griffin, PETA's PETCO Coordinator, told us that their initial two submissions were rejected as unsuitable: the first was for a brick bearing the message \"In memory of all the animals who have suffered and died in PETCO stores nationwide,\" and the second was for a brick reading simply \"Boycott PETCO.\" What to do when you can't get your message in through the front door? As we've seen in other examples , one way to sneak subversive messages into unlikely settings is through the backdoor method of acrostics, message spelled out by the initial letters of a series of words. And again, that's exactly what PETA did, purchasing a brick with the inscription: \"Break Open Your Cold Ones! Toast The Padres! Enjoy This Championship Organization!\": Read as an acrostic, these sentences form a decidedly less friendly message: Break Open Your Cold Ones! Toast The Padres! Enjoy This Champion Organization! According to Ms. Griffin, PETA's aim is to see PETCO give up the sale of live animals altogether, a product line which she says accounts for only 5% of PETCO's business. (PETCO officials maintain that they have investigated some of the reports submitted by PETA, and that most of them are \"mischaracterizations.\") ESPN reported that PETCO wasn't expressing any public consternation over PETA's hidden message: Padres and PETCO officials discussed whether something should be done with the brick, but PETCO executives had no problem with it. \"If you walked by and read their message, you wouldn't know it had anything to do with PETA,\" said Don Cowan, PETCO's director of communications. In 2012, PETA pulled off a similar caper at the Florida Marlins baseball team's new park. Back in 2010, PETA had expressed opposition to the team's plans to install two enormous saltwater aquariums, complete with coral and sea life native to South Florida, in the backstop at that park: \"Being exposed to the loud crowds, bright lights, and reverberations of a baseball stadium would be stressful and maddening for any large animals held captive in tanks that, to them, are like bathtubs,\" wrote PETA executive vice president Tracy Reiman in a letter to [Marlins owner Jeffrey] Loria. PETA said the Marlins should explore alternatives, such as \"artist-designed aquariums full of beautiful blown-glass animals,\" \"high-definition plasma screens showing underwater footage of sea animals,\" and even \"robotic fish that can 'swim' through water.\" \"I hope to hear that you have decided to leave fish in the ocean where they belong,\" Reiman wrote. Prior to the April 2012 opening of the Marlins' new park, PETA purchased an engraved pavement stone to be placed in the park's East Plaza, a stone bearing the inscription \"Florida Is Still Hosting Incredible Night Games. Help Us Reach The Stars. Cheer Our Marlins!\" Read as an acrostic, these sentences also form a decidedly less friendly message: The first letters of the words in the message spell out \"Fishinghurts.com,\" a Web address that the animal right's organization said brings up a page on PETA's website about cruelty involved in fishing. PETA said the hidden message is an effort to draw attention to the plight of fish, who the group says feel pain and suffer when they're caught on a hook or in a net. On its website, the organization said, \"Marlins are a species of fish. And they, like all fish, are much more beautiful alive and swimming in the ocean than on a menu. Fish (including marlins) feel pain, and they suffer when they're caught on a hook or in a net and dragged into an environment in which they can't breathe. It's much better to choose cruelty-free activities instead like, say, watching a baseball game.\" Additional information: \"Boycott PETCO\" Message Sneaks Into Padres Ballpark What's Wrong with PETCO?

Although Packard did not use the term \"subliminal advertising,\" he did describe many of the new \"motivational research\" marketing techniques being employed to sell products in the burgeoning post-war American market. Advertisements that focused on consumers' hopes, fears, guilt, and sexuality were designed to persuade them to buy products they'd never realized they needed. Marketers who could reach into the hearts and minds of American consumers soon found consumers' wallets to be within easy grasp as well.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "It was James Vicary who coined the term \"subliminal advertising.\" Vicary had conducted a variety of unusual studies of female shopping habits, discovering (among other things) that women's eye-blink rates dropped significantly in supermarkets, that \"psychological spring\" lasts more than twice as long as \"psychological winter,\" and that \"the experience of a woman baking a cake could be likened to a woman giving birth.\" Vicary's studies were largely forgettable, save for one experiment he conducted at a Ft. Lee, New Jersey movie theater during the summer of 1957. Vicary placed a tachistoscope in the theater's projection booth, and all throughout the playing of the film Picnic , he flashed a couple of different messages on the screen every five seconds. The messages each displayed for only 1/3000th of a second at a time, far below the viewers' threshold of conscious perceptibility. The result of displaying these imperceptible suggestions \"Drink Coca-Cola\" and \"Hungry? Eat Popcorn\" was an amazing 18.1% increase in Coca-Cola sales, and a whopping 57.8% jump in popcorn purchases. Thus was demonstrated the awesome power of \"subliminal advertising\" to coerce unwary buyers into making purchases they would not otherwise have considered. Or so goes the legend that has retained its potency for more than forty years, which includes the belief the Federal Communications Commission banned \"subliminal advertising\" from radio and television airwaves in 1974, despite that fact that no studies had shown it to be effective, and even though its alleged efficacy was based on a fraud. You see, Vicary lied about the results of his experiment. When he was challenged to repeat the test by the president of the Psychological Corporation, Dr. Henry Link, Vicary's duplication of his original experiment produced no significant increase in popcorn or Coca-Cola sales. Eventually Vicary confessed that he had falsified the data from his first experiments, and some critics have since expressed doubts that he actually conducted his infamous Ft. Lee experiment at all. As usual, the media (and thereby the public) paid attention only to the sensational original story, and the scant coverage given to Vicary's later confession was ignored or quickly forgotten. Radio and television stations began airing subliminal commercials, leading to two congressional bills to ban the practice being introduced in 1958 and 1959 (both of which died before being voted upon). In 1973, Dr. Wilson B. Key picked up where Vicary left off, publishing Subliminal Seduction , an indictment of modern advertisements filled with hidden messages and secret symbols messages and symbols that only Dr. Key could discern (including the notorious example of the word \"S-E-X\" spelled out in the ice cubes pictured in a liquor advertisement). The old \"subliminal advertising\" controversy was stirred up again by Dr. Key's book, leading to the 24 January 1974 announcement by the FCC that subliminal techniques, \"whether effective or not,\" were \"contrary to the public interest,\" and that any station employing them risked losing its broadcast license. For neither the first nor the last time, a great deal of time and money and effort was expended on \"protecting\" the public from something that posed no danger to them. As numerous studies over the last few decades have demonstrated, subliminal advertising doesn't work; in fact, it never worked, and the whole premise was based on a lie from the very beginning. James Vicary's legacy was to ensure that a great many people will never be convinced otherwise, however.

Specifically, what was unusual was that the English and French statements on those tags didn't quite match: while both versions included the usual admonitions not to use bleach, not to machine dry, and not to iron the bags, the French-language version included an extra phrase: \"NOUS SOMMES DESOLES QUE NOTRE PRESIDENT SOIT UN IDIOT. NOUS N'AVONS PAS VOTE POUR LUI.\" Roughly translated, this statement reads in English as: \"We're sorry our president is an idiot. We didn't vote for him.\" That this statement appeared on Tom Bihn tags is apparent; the pertinent questions were who put it there, and what did it mean? Most consumers viewed this message at the time as an obviously deliberate (and, to many, inappropriate) slam at then U.S. President George W. Bush , but the company's response to the controversy was coy, maintaining that the \"message began as an inside joke among seamstresses and staff at the Tom Bihn factory, and was apparently intended to poke fun at company's founder and president, Tom Bihn\": Tom Bihn, president of the eponymous company, said he doesn't know which of his 10 employees are responsible. \"They know my French is so bad they could sneak it past me,\" he said. But he doesn't appear to be too determined to root out the guilty party and said he's \"not opposed to the sentiments\" about Mr. Bush. \"We haven't looked really hard to find out who did it because it's good for us. When we find them, we'll give them a raise,\" said Mr. Bihn, who insists the \"president\" mentioned on the tag is a reference to himself as the company's president and not to Mr. Bush. The tag has \"hit a resonating chord\" all over the world, including France, where some customers believe the reference is to their president, Jacques Chirac. \"People out there think a number of presidents are idiots,\" said Mr. Bihn. \"It's a universal message.\" More cynical observers believed the message was planted by Bihn himself as a means of garnering publicity for his company, with just enough ambiguity built in to get his point across while maintaining a modicum of deniability. (The idea doesn't even appear to be original to Tom Bihn, as Joel Aufrecht was selling \"American Traveler International Apology Shirts\" with the very same message printed on them in six different languages back in 2003.)

Procter and Gamble, for instance, has for decades battled the rumor that it supports Satanism, a belief fueled in part by what some were determined to make of the beard curlicues of the company's old-fashioned \"man in the moon\" logo , and numerous Canadians thought they spied the Devil in the Queen's portrait on the banknotes issued by that country in 1954.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Vans, the athletic shoes most frequently associated with the California skate scene, has inadvertently engendered a similar belief thanks to the design of its product. Those who stare long enough at the sole of a Vans shoe will eventually see a pattern of interlocking six-sided stars in the honeycomb portion that supports the ball of the foot. While six-sided stars have been used for other purposes across the span of human history, that figure is now most commonly regarded as the \"Star of David,\" a symbol that represents Judaism. This appearance has led to the development of the product-related rumor that Vans shoes have an anti-Semitic message worked into them, and thus buyers of this type of footwear are, whether they know it or not, participating in \"walking on the Jews\" (i.e., symbolically killing them). Our earliest print sighting of this rumor dates to 1998, but the belief was likely around well before that. Yet resemblance between the pattern worked into part of the sole and the Star of David notwithstanding, there is nothing to the rumor that the company's owners \"hate Jews,\" \"are neo-Nazis,\" or have pulled a fast one on their customers by tricking them into \"stepping on, and killing a jew\" (statements that have come to use over the years from those who've encountered the rumor). Rather, the six-sided motif was placed there in all innocence: The honeycomb shape of that portion of the sole provides more secure footing for the skaters who have come to favor this brand (in part for that very reason). Those who worked on the sole's design didn't even recognize the Star of David in what they were fashioning that this honeycomb or hexagon pattern has come to be regarded as bearing an anti-Semitic message caught them, well, flat-footed. The Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) says this about the Vans Shoes rumor: An e-mail rumor long circulated on the Internet suggests that the maker of Vans skateboarding shoes is anti-Jewish because some of their shoes come with a pattern resembling a Star of David on a portion of their outsole (bottom). Some of the more conspiracy-minded e-mails suggest that this pattern was created by the company to put Jews down (\"step on Jews\") or that the company was \"founded by neo-Nazis.\" ADL has concluded that there is no truth to any of these allegations. While ADL understands that the use of the Star of David pattern in this context may be offensive to some, there is no factual basis to believe that the maker of Vans shoes incorporated the six-pointed star design in an attempt to insult Jews. Over the years the company has sought to reassure inquirers that the trademarked pattern is just that a pattern with no intended anti-Jewish message. After contacting the company in the 1990s when the rumor began spreading, ADL was reassured by the chief executive office of Vans that the interlinking six-pointed star pattern on their shoes dated from the founding of the company and \"was not done with even any awareness that it was the Star of David.\" The League accepts the company's explanation that the design is in fact just a design.

Being the largest of the fast food giants, McDonald's serves as the focus for a number of them, including the belief the company uses worm meat in its hamburgers or chicken feathers in its shakes to cut costs.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Another rumor attached to McDonald's asserts the company gets around truth in advertising laws regarding the meat it uses in its burgers by purchasing that commodity from a misleadingly named company. In different versions of the rumor we've encountered, the complicit business entity is named 'The All-Beef Company,' '100% Beef,' '100% Beef Company,' or even (in the versions told Down Under) '100% Australian Beef.' This legal fiction supposedly enables McDonald's to continue to advertise its burgers as using 100% pure beef even as they incorporate the meat of other animals or soy products into the patties. While it's a fascinating tale, there's nothing to it: McDonald's hamburger patties in the U.S. are made with 100% USDA-inspected beef. They are cooked and prepared with salt, pepper and nothing else; no preservatives, no fillers. McDonald's of Australia's \"Make Up Your Own Mind\" web site said the following of the rumor in its Top FAQs section: Is it true that McDonald's created a company called \"100% Australian Beef\" just so they can say that in their advertising? No. The beef that we use comes from Australian farms. McDonald's Australia only ever uses premium, export quality beef. Our patties are made by two companies; OSI Foods and Australian Food Corporation. Those who continue to harbor doubts about the 100% beef claim should examine the ingredient lists on McDonald's web site. All of the chain's hamburgers are made from \"100% beef patties\"; furthermore, they define \"beef patty\" as being \"100% pure USDA inspected beef; no additives, no fillers, no extenders.\" It's not that easy to get around truth in advertising rules in the U.S. While in the realm of legend a legal fiction such as a company titled \"All Beef\" might suffice, in the real world the Federal Trade Commission wouldn't stand for it. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act , that government entity is empowered to \"prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations\" from using \"unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\" Consumers have legal remedy available to them against corporations that have deceived them through certain provisions of the Lanham Act. Rumor usually positions the fictional All Beef or 100% Beef company as a meat supplier, but there have been exceptions: On the wax paper holding the McDonald's burgers it's printed 100% beef. I was told that was just a company name that provides oat fillers for the burgers. In a related version of the rumor, a different target (Birdseye) takes the place of McDonald's: In the UK in the 90's the Birdseye brand had a big advertising campaign running promoting 100% beef burgers. Urban legend I have heard says that this promotion ran at the same time as the Australian kangaroo cull and so Birdseye had bought up kangaroo meat for use in these burgers. Hence why they were 100% meat yet not much more expensive than other frozen burgers on the market which contained filler. The \"All Beef\" rumor matches stride with another false tale about an entity's deliberately labeling its consumables in misleading fashion to facilitate the hoodwinking of consumers into thinking they're getting better products than they are. In that other tale, Diet Coke and/or Diet Pepsi supposedly contain far more calories than claimed, but their manufacturers get away with the deception simply by paying a yearly fine.

of its contents, but this is the first case we encountered regarding packaging that confused retailers about the price of their own wares.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "In 2005, Sony BMG released a 3-CD set entitled Electric 80s The cover art for this compilation of \"the greatest Eighties electric hits\" featured a reproduction of a UPC bar code, with the title \"ELECTRIC 80s\" placed in the space at the bottom of the bar code where the human-readable numbers corresponding to that code would usually appear: (The real bar code used for scanning the price of the item at checkout counters was placed in a corner on the back of the packaging, as it is for nearly every other similar item.) Unfortunately for some retailers, the machine-readable version of the bar code used for the CD compilation's cover art was scannable by their systems, and sales clerks at those outlets who mistakenly passed the CD's cover (rather than its back) over point-of-purchase scanners ended up ringing up sales for 9.77, (US $17.46) considerably less than the set's listed price of 14.97 (US $26.76). The mis-scanning also messed with stores' inventory tracking systems, as scanning the front of the Electric 80s CD often recorded a sale of singer Jack Johnson's new CD, In Between Dreams , instead. One music chain took advantage of the issue to crow about how they'd had no problems because their clerks were properly trained and claimed that the incident demonstrated the value of shopping for CDs at speciality music stores rather than general retailers (even though the mistake actually favored consumers): Music retailer HMV Group was aware of the quirky barcode-covered album, but said it has not had any problems and used the gaffe as an opportunity to tout the benefits of being a specialist. \"Someone would have to be pretty stupid not to recognize that,\" HMV spokesman Gennaro Castaldo said. \"The proper barcodes are always done on the reverse of the CD,\" he added. \"All our staff are aware it's the cover artwork, and if fellow retailers and supermarkets are [scanning] that, it just highlights that they're not really music specialists. We've not had any issues.\" News accounts of the time noted that stores were pulling the Electric 80s set while a new version with more conventional cover art was being rushed to market, but we never did see a revised version of Electric 80s offered for sale anywhere.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007OC71O/qid=1123702688/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/202-9310881-3212669;http://www.barcoding.com/information/barcode_history.shtml;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009S4WLG/qid%3D1123702609/202-9310881-3212669;", "Example": "", "Last Updated": "18 April 2015", "Credibility": "true", "URL": "www.snopes.com/business/market/cdbarcode.asp", "Claim": "Retailers mistakenly scanned the wrong side of a CD bearing bar code-themed cover art, resulting in lower prices for customers.", "Claim_ID": "business_market_cdbarcode", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "sg.answers.yahoo.com", "link": "https://sg.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20160118220005AAYmetI", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/business/market/cdbarcode.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "sehog.com", "link": "http://sehog.com/code-confusion/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "cuhil.com", "link": "http://cuhil.com/code-confusion/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "groups.google.com", "link": "https://groups.google.com/d/topic/christiansunchained/JLfGUgi3kJg", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "j-walkblog.com", "link": "http://j-walkblog.com/index.php?/weblog/comments/bar_code_confusion/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "informationnation.blogspot.com", "link": "http://informationnation.blogspot.com/2008/04/zebra-roundup.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "wb.itboards.com", "link": "http://wb.itboards.com/wb/default.asp?action=9&fid=52&read=162764", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "m.delphiforums.com", "link": "http://m.delphiforums.com/newtish/messages/46433/125", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "personzz.com", "link": "http://personzz.com/q/bar+code", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "www.cult-labs.com", "link": "https://www.cult-labs.com/forums/music/12961-your-vinyl-collection-4.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "wewerethecoolkids.blogspot.com", "link": "http://wewerethecoolkids.blogspot.com/2007/07/blogathon-post-24-urban-legends-did.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "timelock.blogspot.com", "link": "http://timelock.blogspot.com/2005/08/clear-skies.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "link": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2029808/Tesco-branded-shoplifter--happen-YOU.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "omsssignal.blogspot.com", "link": "http://omsssignal.blogspot.com/2010_10_03_archive.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.joebaugher.com", "link": "http://www.joebaugher.com/copyright.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "about.usps.com", "link": "https://about.usps.com/publications/pub32/pub32_terms.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.mondaynote.com", "link": "http://www.mondaynote.com/2014/12/08/the-rise-of-adblock-reveals-a-serious-problem-in-the-advertising-ecosystem/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.businessballs.com", "link": "http://www.businessballs.com/acronyms.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "archive.org", "link": "https://archive.org/stream/fp_Naomi_Klein-No_Logo/Naomi_Klein-No_Logo_djvu.txt", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "www.repairfaq.org", "link": "http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/monfaq.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "waitbutwhy.com", "link": "http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.phonemicchart.com", "link": "http://www.phonemicchart.com/transcribe/biglist.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "web.mit.edu", "link": "http://web.mit.edu/~ecprice/Public/wordlist.ranked", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "web.mit.edu", "link": "http://web.mit.edu/adamrose/Public/googlelist", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.auxpetitsjoueurs.com", "link": "http://www.auxpetitsjoueurs.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=43&Itemid=56&6279d801f59b9bec217a1fc74664415e=", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.newyorker.com", "link": "http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/02/the-mark", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.thelightapp.com", "link": "http://www.thelightapp.com/answers/query/What_forces_need_to_be_balanced_in_order_for_a_satellite_to_remain_in_orbit_around_the_Earth/aE2eG19GG6", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "stuffwhitepeoplelike.com", "link": "http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/about/", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "The Subservient Chicken is . . . uh, describing it as anything other than \"odd\" would be superfluous. Here's one attempt at characterizing the phenomenon that confronts web surfers who visit the subservientchicken.com web site:", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The garter-clad subservient chicken can be prompted to do one's bidding in response to a variety of keywords. Some of the more amusing entries to try are: die strip dance lay egg sing eat elephant read fly clean room Actually, the chicken has a repertoire of about 300 different actions, each triggered by the entry of one of the combinations of nouns, verbs and other parts of speech programmed into its \"vocabulary.\" A complete list of trigger words and the clips they invoke has already been posted to the Internet, although it appears the clips can no longer be viewed directly from external web links. (That is, if you want to see the chicken jump, you have to go to subservientchicken.com and enter the command \"jump\" if you try to go directly to the URL for the \"jump\" clip, all you'll see is the chicken waving an accusatory finger at you.) A Subservient Chicken Request List was also established to chronicle the actions the chicken will or will not perform. The Subservient Chicken web site also includes links for a cut-out chicken mask (instructions: \"1. Cut along dotted line. 2. Put on chicken face. 3. Be subservient\") and a Subservient Chicken photo gallery . The most frequently asked question about Subservient Chicken was, of course, whether he was really affiliated with the Burger King fast food chain, or whether he was just the product of an Internet prankster who stuck a Burger King link on his web site. The chicken had some obvious links (no pun intended) to Burger King: subservientchicken.com displayed a Burger King logo while loading and included a link to BK.com, and the domain name was registered by Crispin Porter + Bogusky , the advertising agency that replaced Young & Rubicam as Burger King's lead creative ad agency in January 2004, . Any doubt about the connection was ended when mention of the Subservient Chicken web site started appearing in Burger King television commercials. As the Wall Street Journal reported, subservientchicken.com was another instance of a commercial promotion accomplished through furtively launched \"viral marketing\" techniques: Designed by Crispin, the Web promotion represents a classic example of viral marketing promotions that catch on via word-of-mouth rather than a flashy ad campaign on a more established medium such as TV, radio or a magazine. \"The intent here is to speak specifically to young adults in their 20s and 30s. These are people that are very Internet savvy,\" says Blake Lewis, a spokesman for Burger King, which is controlled by Texas Pacific Group. \"They are very active. They may not mirror a lot of the traditional TV, newspaper or radio consumption patterns that older adults have come to adopt.\" The subservientchicken.com Web site launched the evening of April 7, Mr. Lewis says, and only 20 people were told about it all friends of people who worked at the ad agency. Some TV ads have flashed the Web address. Burger King says the site has received 15 million to 20 million hits. According to the agency, Web surfers have spent an average of six minutes exploring the fowl game. Since \"Have it your way\" has long been a famous Burger King motto (and registered trademark) promoting their policy of allowing the customer to have \"hamburger the way you want it,\" it only made sense for Burger King to offer \"chicken the way you want it\" as well.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.promomagazine.com/ar/marketing_burger_king_ousts/;http://www.cpbmiami.com/;http://www.subservientchicken.com/html/gallery01.html;http://www.subservientchicken.com/chickenmask.pdf;http://www.subservientchicken.com/clips/clip_33.swf;http://www.xeni.net/images/bb/clipData.html;http://www.subservientchicken.com/;", "Example": "So I have to know - is http://www.subservientchicken.com really affiliated with Burger King?

print advertising of the day for watches and clocks will sooner or later be struck by a seemingly startling realization: the hands in just about every timepiece's ad will be set to ten minutes past ten. Yet this is not the supernatural quietly at work via synchronicity to instill in us a reverence for a particularly important time of day; the \"coincidence\" is attributable to no more than the good marketing practice of presenting the manufacturer's name or logo to the buying public in the fashion most pleasing to the eye.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The hands of clocks and watches shown in advertisements are most commonly set to 10 minutes past ten in an effort to best frame the manufacturer's logo or emblem, which is often displayed on the faces of timepieces just below the 12. Those who grew up watching television in the 1960s were subject to the myriad of \"It takes a licking but keeps on ticking\" Timex ads that burned into their consciousness both that particular spot on a watch face for a logo and the 10:10 position for the watch's hands. Before the 10:10 hand position became somewhat the industry's standard, some watches whose logos appeared above the 6 would be displayed in advertisements with their hands at the 20 past 8 position (8:20), the timepiece's hands once again being used to frame the manufacturer's mark. This practice, however, has mostly passed out of favor since downward pointing hands are now seen as undesirable because they make the timepiece appear to frown and thus impart a negative message to prospective buyers. People have been puzzling about the wherefores and whys of timepiece hand placement for many a year, as this sighting from 1934 demonstrates: The hands on dummy clocks and watches used by jewelers for advertising purposes almost invariably point to eighteen minutes past eight. There is a popular belief that the man who painted the first of these wooden clocks and watches had just heard of the death of Abraham Lincoln and that he painted the hands to perpetuate the fatal hour. According to one version of the story, the hands commemorate the exact time of Lincoln's death, and according to another, the exact time of his assassination. As a matter of fact Lincoln was shot at 10:10 in the evening and died about 7:30 the next morning. But the belief is more conclusively disproved by the fact that these wooden watches and clocks, with the hands pointing to eighteen minutes past eight, were hanging as signs in front of jewelry shops long before the assassination of Lincoln. The real reason for so placing the hands is obvious. It is the most symmetrical arrangement possible for the hands, being pleasing to the eye, and at the same time leaving the greatest possible amount of space for advertising matter, such as the name of the jeweler. It will be noted that at 8:18 the hands are the same distance from the 12 and the 6 and two-thirds of the space on the dial is above the hands. For what it's worth, Abraham Lincoln did not die at 8:20, although (as best history records it) his death did occur at roughly 20 past the hour. Lincoln was shot by actor John Wilkes Booth while attending a play at Ford's Theatre at approximately 10:13 on the evening of 14 April 1865; he was then carried across the street to Petersen's boarding house, where he drew his last breath at about 7:22 the next morning. As for John F. Kennedy, he was shot in the head in Dallas, Texas, at 12:30 p.m. on 22 November 1963 and was pronounced dead at 1:00 p.m. that day. The time of Lincoln's death features in another belief, one having to do with sudden silences that always seem to fall upon groups of people at 20 minutes past the hour.

The answer to why Harley-Davidson would supposedly do such a thing is as a form of symbolic revenge on the Japanese motorcycle companies who eroded the sales of good ol' American Harley-Davidson bikes during the 1970s and 1980s. The answer to why people would believe such a thing is a tale spun from a collection of manufactured coincidences: The \"Fat Boy\" is silver, just like the Enola Gay and Bock's Car, the two B-29s used to drop atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The bike has disc wheels which look similar to the type used on airplanes such as the B-29. Seven gold rings can be found on the motorcycle, the same markings that were allegedly present on the two atomic bombs.

The FLSTF is silver simply because it's a nifty color for a motorcycle, the disc wheels were chosen for their look, the \"gold rings\" are merely styling touches added to accent certain parts of the bike, and the name \"Fat Boy\" comes from the observation that the motorcycle is rather wide when viewed head-on.

No one ever suggests that Mars might have already had its advertising budget locked for that year, or that it might have felt ill at ease at the prospect of dealing with a new advertising medium and the new people who went with it, or any other plausible and purely logical business reason for taking a pass on this offer. No, the \"reason\" offered in lore will always be something along the lines of \"Mars didn't think much of the planned movie and thus wanted to keep themselves separate from it,\" a \"reason\" that casts the candymaker as unbelievably short-sighted given the breathtaking success of E.T. Whatever the reason for it, Mars' \"No\" paved the way for Hershey's \"Yes.\" The spurned offer was then tendered to Hershey, and misgivings aside that corporation went for it. Hershey did not pay to have Reese's Pieces used in E.T. , but it did agree to do a tie-in between the movie and the candy after the film was released. A deal was inked wherein Hershey Foods agreed to promote E.T. with $1 million of advertising; in return, Hershey could use E.T. in its own ads. Within two weeks of the movie's premiere, Reese's Pieces sales went through the roof. (Disagreement exists as to how far through the roof they went: Sales were variously described as having tripled, experienced an 85% jump, or increased by 65%). Whatever the numbers, though, Reese's Pieces up until then an underdog confection only faintly known by the U.S. candy-consuming public were suddenly being consumed in great handfuls. And all thanks to a shy little alien lured from the bushes and into America's hearts by a trail of peanut-butter-in-a-candy-coated-shell confections. Thus is the potential power of product placement. When it's done right, it can make a product. Paid product placement in films has come to be one of the ordinary ways of things in Hollywood. Exxon paid $300,000 for its name to appear in Days of Thunder , Pampers paid $50,000 to be featured in Three Men and a Baby , and Cuervo Gold spent $150,000 for placement in Tequila Sunrise , according to Danny Thompson, president of Creative Entertainment Services, in a 1993 New York magazine interview. As for how effective the practice of product placement is, that same article quotes Joel Henrie, a partner at Motion Picture Placement, as saying: \"Look what happened to Hermes scarves after Basic Instinct , Ray-Ban sunglasses after Risky Business , and suspenders after Michael Douglas wore them in Wall Street .\" Not all product placement deals are \"straight-fee\" arrangements. There are actually three types of deals, the other two being the provision of costly merchandise (such as automobiles or appliances) for free just for the exposure (which accounts for about half of all placements), and the back-end promotion under which big corporations with huge promotional budgets aim for young audiences through tie-ins with popular films. In most films, product placement, while noticeable, is kept low-key. However, some Hollywood offerings have gone down in the annals of motion picture history as notorious examples of rampant commercialism. The 1988 snoozer Mac and Me could fairly be described as a ninety-minute advert for McDonald's and Coca-Cola, with an alien thrown in whenever things were running slow. Likewise, the 1987 film Leonard Part 6 was deemed by many to be a never-ending Coca-Cola commercial. But rampant product placement is not merely limited to forgettable films which did poorly at the box office, as 1999's Runaway Bride proved. (In that film, everyone walks around with a copy of USA Today in his hands.) Product placement in movies is now a corporate fact of life, as are \"bonehead\" accounts of great marketing opportunities left to the other guy. One company's gaffe becomes the cautionary tale passed along to those in all manner of industries because the message is universal: This could be us one day if we don't maintain vigilance. Once again, folklore is called upon to teach by example what might not have effectively been learned from a book. In an odd way, true-life corporate instances of one man's garbage turning out to be another man's treasure are almost a rip on the standard Hollywood legend of (pick your favorite movie star) was offered the lead in (now unforgettable, hugely-popular film) but turned it down. Though that scenario has indeed played out a number of times in Tinseltown, it hasn't happened nearly as often as is reported. In many cases, remembered tidbits of so-and-so's having been mentioned merely in passing at a studio round-table of \"Who could we get?\" are mentally embroidered into memories of the role's having been offered to the star, who waved it away. Or a bit of rumor is later remembered as fact, such as the case of Ronald Reagan, whose name was only kited as part of a press release designed to drum up interest in Casablanca but is now widely believed to have been the studio's first choice to play Rick Blaine a role never intended for anyone but Humphrey Bogart.

Without its memorable signs and the place they came to hold in the American heart, Burma-Shave would likely never have amounted to much more than just another forgettable-but-good shaving cream.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "In the early 1920s, patriarch Leonard Odell saw possibilities in an old family formulation, a noxious liniment he claimed his grandfather had secured from an old sea captain. This liniment had one special property beyond its smell: It was wonderfully effective on burns. This was discovered by an aunt who had severely scorched her hand in hot fat and who, in desperation, plunged the injured extremity into a batch of the liniment. It immediately took away the pain, and the hand healed with no blisters or scars. Foul-smelling liniments were commonplace, but Odell deemed one that effective on burns a goldmine waiting to be dug into. The substance was christened Burma-Vita , Burma because most of its essential oils came from the Malay peninsula and Burma, and Vita from the Latin for life and vigor . The Burma-Vita company (well populated with Odells) was formed to manufacture and market it. Despite its healing properties, the product did not sell well its smell ensured folks would only use it under the most dire of circumstances. The local wholesale drug company secured for the foundering company a supply of Lloyd's Euxesis , a brushless shaving cream from England, with the idea that Burma-Vita would do better selling a product its consumers would use every day. Odell wasn't yet ready to give up on being an entrepreneur, though. Instead of working to become Lloyd's Euxesis' agent in America, he commissioned a chemist to develop a better shaving cream. Burma-Shave #1 was horrible stuff, and it wasn't until the 143rd formulation that the company finally hit upon a winning combination. Not that they knew it immediately, though they were approaching their 300th formulation when Odell rediscovered an old jar of 143, tried it, and was struck with the realization of what the company had. A fresh batch of 143 was unremarkable, but a batch that had been aged two or three months resulted in a fine shave. With a saleable product finally in place, marketing became the prime concern. A small series of roadside signs advertising an upcoming gas station attracted the attention of another of the Odells one day, and he thought to himself, \"Every time I see one of those setups, I read every one of the signs. So why can't you sell a product that way?\" Why not indeed? Thus was born what would come to be the poetry of the roadside, little series of signs advertising Burma-Shave that would dot the nation. The first were introduced into the American landscape in 1925. The only states they never formally appeared in were Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico (deemed too low in population density) and Massachusetts (too many winding roads and obscuring foliage). Yet elsewhere where there were cars, there were Burma-Shave signs. Burma-Shave adverts took the form of simply-lettered, unillustrated little white signs stretched in progressions alongside roads. Each sign displayed a snippet of doggerel with one snippet leading to the next, the whole forming an amusing poem that would tickle the fancy of motorists even while it assured them of the need to buy Burma-Shave (and only Burma-Shave). America took to the intriguing progressions of Burma-Shave signs because these were lighthearted communications each sign added to the anticipation of what the next would say. It was impossible to not be charmed by such offerings as: He Played A Sax Had No B.O. But His Whiskers Scratched So She Let Him Go Burma-Shave The company established an annual contest open to all who hankered to create a Burma-Shave jingle. Each verse adopted netted its author $100, and there was no shortage of entries, with upwards of 50,000 rolling in per call for verses. In 1935 Burma-Shave began running \"public service\" jingles in addition to its pure sales pitches: Don't Take A Curve At 60 Per We Hate To Lose A Customer Burma-Shave Keep Well To The Right Of The Oncoming Car Get Your Close Shaves From The Half-Pound Jar Burma-Shave Don't Pass Cars On Curve Or Hill If The Cops Don't Get You Morticians Will Burma-Shave Sometimes Burma-Shave's poetic offerings caused a bit of a stir for the company. Whimsy was, on occasion, mistaken for serious intent. At a time when retailing was overrun with a fad for coupons, Burma-Shave kited a roadside rhyme that should have been taken as a joke: Free Offer! Free Offer! Rip A Fender Off Your Car Mail It In For A Half-Pound Jar Burma-Shave Most interpreted the jingle as a humorous comment on the current craze, laughed, and drove on. Some, however, chose to ride the \"something for nothing\" rainbow to see if the company wouldn't make good on its promise. Scores of banged-up old fenders were soon on their way to the plant, many by parcel post. The more enterprising claimants scavenged nearby junkyards, then carried their finds to the Burma-Shave offices. Smarter hopefuls merely mailed in fenders torn from toy cars. All fender-bearers were greeted politely, relieved of their automotive \"coupons,\" and provided with the promised half-pound jar. In the long run, the publicity benefit to Burma-Shave more than compensated for the free product handed out and the cost of hauling those fenders back to the junkyard. Redeemed fenders aside, the ultimate \"battle for a freebie\" arose over another set of signs, this one planted in 1955: Free Free A Trip To Mars For 900 Empty Jars Burma-Shave Unlike the car fender fiasco, this playful spouting looked safe to the company there might be car fenders aplenty to be found, but 900 empty Burma-Shave jars was going to prove far harder to come by. Yet Burma-Shave had not reckoned on the determination of Arliss French, manager of a supermarket in Appleton, Wisconsin. Mr. French wired Burma-Shave he was accepting its offer where should the jars be shipped? In response, the company wired back: If A Trip To Mars You Earn Remember, Friend There's No Return French was not to be dissuaded. He countered with another telegram: Let's Not Quibble Let's Not Fret Gather Your Forces I'm All Set What could Burma-Shave do but respond? Our Rockets Are Ready We Ain't Splitting Hairs Just Send Us The Jars And Arrange Your Affairs Underneath the bravado, Burma-Shave was concerned. It sent Ralph Getchman, the company's general manager, to Appleton to find out what was going on and determine just how serious this French fellow was. Getchman's report was not what the home office had been hoping for. Arliss French's store was festooned with reproductions of the key Burma-Shave signs. Full-page ads run in the local paper entreated: \"Send Frenchy to Mars!\" Within the store was a huge pile of empty jars, and it was growing day by day. Also in the store was a mock rocket ship for the kids to swarm over. And from the roof of the establishment, little green men (two of French's seven children) fired toy rocket gliders out over the parking lot. On the spur of the moment, the head of Burma-Shave recommended offering the determined grocer a trip to the Mars Candy Company in Chicago for a weekend on the town. It was that spontaneous utterance that planted the suggestion of a solution in his head, a solution that was to provide everyone with enough wiggle room to look like the offer had been honored. When French presented himself at Burma-Shave's head office, he was dressed for his trip he arrived sporting a football helmet on his head and clad in a silvery space suit with a Red Owl symbol (the trademark of the grocery chain store heworked for) on the front. His 900 jars arrived in a Brink's armored truck emblazoned with a \"Send Frenchy To Mars!\" sign. Burma-Shave was ready it presented tickets for French and his wife to travel to Moers, a little town in Germany that mercifully pronounced its name \"mars.\" The Frenches were handed full jars of Burma-Shave and given the advice they be used to barter with the natives for goods and services. The photos were many and the news coverage extensive. The Frenches enjoyed their German vacation, and Burma-Shave once again netted more by way of publicity than it lost in meeting its obligation. All good things come to an end, even Burma-Shave adverts. The Burma-Vita Company was sold to Philip Morris, Inc. in 1963, and that same year Burma-Shave stopped placing its cascades of signs by the roadside. Two generations have since arrived that have not seen Burma-Shave signs in their natural habitat, yet at one time it would have been nigh on impossible to uncover any American whose journeys hadn't been enlivened by them.

Naugas are fictional creatures invented solely as a marketing device to help sell naugahyde a vinyl-coated fabric developed by Uniroyal Engineered Products, Inc. which was then seen as a cheap imitation leather. There are no naugas, although joking references to them may have soothed consumers' unfamiliarity with what might otherwise have been perceived as a distinctly synthetic (and thus at that time a slightly threatening) product. As for how naugahyde came by its name, it's worth mentioning that Uniroyal Engineered Products, Inc. was located in Naugatuck, Conn. These days, most folks accept the nauga as a playful bit of lore and employ references to it as part of other leg-pulls. Such was the case in 1992 when Dean Cliver, then a professor of microbiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, touched off a spirited discussion in the pages of the Wisconsin State Journal by penning a tongue-in-cheek missive decrying the fate of the Belgian Velcro. Cliver claimed this small, friendly animal was being slaughtered indiscriminately for its fur, which was then turned into Velcro fasteners through a tanning process which involved the Velcros' being sat upon by fat men wearing Teflon pants in order to make the hairs hook. His letter attracted a spate of responses from other \"animal lovers\" protesting the harvesting of Naugas and Esters (for use in Naugahyde and polyester.) Cliver also once wrote that bullfights, rather than being inhumane, are the only method of producing beef that gives the animal any say in the matter. Jokes about the nauga go back much further than Cliver's articles, though. In 1981 banker Al Rosenberg, posing as fictional inventor Earl C. Watkins, regaled the audience of New York's 'The Improvisation' comedy club with an exhortation to join his \"Save the Nauga\" project. Rosenberg told his audience the nauga was \"the animal from which naugahyde is obtained, the hide that all office furniture is covered with.\" Because office furniture was multiplying so fast, he said, the nauga was becoming extinct. What made efforts to save the nauga the 5,000-pound males, the 3,000-pound females and footstool-shaped offspring called \"uglettes\" so toilsome was \"that a herd of naugas is often mistaken for a roomful of furniture,\" something difficult for people to become heartsick about. Ah, but the mythical nauga had never been in any danger at all. According to NaugaCase Information Center's \"Adopt a Nauga\" program (a site wherein you'll also find the whimsical history of the Nauga ): Naugas do give up their hydes. But they do it willingly and they shed their skins quite often. They live to give again and again. In fact, Naugas are so willing to please that they often shed their hyde several times a year. No self-respecting hunter would ever try to hurt a Nauga. However, to protect the little Naugas from the curious, they now are living on a secret ranch somewhere near Stoughton, Wisconsin.

After a bit of cursory searching, I enlisted a few colleagues (who also had not heard of such an animal). Fifteen minutes later, we still had no answers. I got back on the phone and told the patron she could help narrow our search if she could at least tell us in which phylum or class naugas resided.

We view wine as a luxury item, and since we reject the intellectual construct that such an item can be both good and inexpensive, we instead seize upon plausible-sounding (but apocryphal) tales to explain the disparity between cheapness and quality. Good wine must be expensive, and if a good wine is being vended at a bargain price, there must be a calamitous reason for this fortuity. In early 2002, rumors of airlines dumping their Merlot (and the like) were launched from this springboard.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "As the Los Angeles Times noted in a 2002 article about the burgeoning sales of Charles Shaw label wines: The morning after a friend served Anna McNeal a glass of Charles Shaw Merlot, she made a beeline to the Mid-Wilshire Trader Joe's to stock up on the wine selling at an astonishing $1.99 a bottle. \"I had to come and get a case,\" she said in a checkout line with half a dozen other shoppers who had somehow heard of the mysterious \"Napa\" wine. Since it was introduced in February, Charles Shaw wine has gained a cult-like following in Southern California, with wine drinkers backing their cars up to the loading dock of the Los Angeles-based discounter to lay in a supply of the Trader Joe's exclusive. \"It's selling like crazy,\" said Jon Fredrikson, a wine consultant based in San Mateo County. \"A great story for consumers.\" Why was such a popular wine (Charles Shaw was one of the top 20 brands in the U.S.) being sold so cheaply? As usual, consumers collectively created several inventive urban legend-like explanations for this seemingly inexplicable phenomenon: Security regulations enacted after the September 11 terrorist attacks prohibited the carrying or use of corkscrews on commercial flights, so several airlines dumped their large stocks of wine on the market, thereby depressing prices. Financially-distressed United Airlines attempted to raise some quick cash by selling its food service stocks, including an ample supply of Charles Shaw wine. Charles Shaw himself, engaged in a bitter divorce struggle, attempted to reduce the value of his winery's assets by flooding the market with cheap wine. Also as usual, the real explanation why many wine brands (not just Charles Shaw) could be had so cheaply at the time (2001) was a mundane one: the market was experiencing a wine glut. The wine boom of the 1990s led vineyards to increase production, but a downturn in the U.S. economy and the effects of September 11 resulted in a greatly lessened demand (particularly in the restaurant industry), creating such an oversupply that many wines were selling for less than the cost of production. Some vintners in northern California were even allowing their grapes to wither on the vine because the cost of picking them exceeded their market value. The Charles Shaw label (known in local slang as \"Two-Buck Chuck\") was the focus of those \"cheap wine\" rumors because it bore a prestigious Napa label, even though it sold for less than $2 per bottle. The catch was that it's made with cheaper grapes from California's Central Valley rather than more desirable grapes from the Napa Valley , but because the label's parent company does own a winery and bottling facility in Napa, it is allowed to put \"Napa\" on the Charles Shaw label (which only indicates that the wine is \"bottled and cellared\" in Napa) even if the grapes used in the wine actually come from some other part of California: [W]ine industry experts say that despite the classy Napa label, there probably isn't a hint of those pricey grapes in a bottle of Charles Shaw Merlot, Chardonnay or Cabernet Sauvignon. Even with the depressed market, grapes from Napa sell for around $2,000 a ton, said Brian Sudano of Beverage Marketing Corp. To make money on a $2 bottle, he added, a vintner would have to buy grapes for around $200 a ton the price of less desirable Central Valley grapes. This summer the market price for those grapes hit a low of $60 a ton. Swimming in excess wine, [Bronco Wine Co. head] Franzia revived the Charles Shaw label, believing it would be more cost-effective to dump his wine on the consumer market than to pour it on the ground. Taking advantage of the depressed wine grape market, he also bought up excess stock from other Central Valley vintners, according to several wine industry sources. \"Franzia was able to take advantage of distress sales by other vineyards, said [wine consultant Jon] Fredrikson. \"And he's got the high-speed production lines to do it and still make money.\" The Bronco Wine Co. produces a variety of low-cost wines, and its president, Fred Franzia, has earned the enmity of plenty of other Wine Country citizens: Franzia was forced to step down as Bronco's president for five years after Bronco was fined $3 million in 1993 for misidentifying grape varietals on its labels, and other Napa vintners have long been disputing Bronco's use of \"Napa\" in the names of wines, such as their \"Napa Ridge\" variety, made from grapes grown elsewhere (but so far the courts have sided with Bronco). That enmity was famously (albeit accurately) expressed in 2011 by Chris Knox, a self-described vintner who once caustically asserted on Quora, in a since deleted response to an inquiry about why Trader Joe's wine (and the Charles Shaw blend in particular) was sold so cheaply, that those wines were inexpensive to buy because they were ... well, made cheaply: The basic gist of it all is that Two Buck Chuck is owned by Bronco Wines, which is owned by Fred Franzia, a trash-mouthed, unapologetic downright crude and shrewd business man who sees it as his mission to pretty much remove any shred of pretentiousness (and dare I say integrity and quality along with it) from the wine world. He started by buying the then failing Charles Shaw label years ago along with massive amounts of bulk wine in the 90's for pennies on the dollar and a staggering 35,000 acres of land in the very cheap San Joaquin Valley which he then planted to vines. That gives his Bronco Wines the prestige of holding the most acreage of vines of any American winery, even surpassing Mondavi and Gallo. A few things to keep in mind about his vineyards: one is that they are located in what is known as the Central Valley in the California wine world which is notoriously flat and quite hot producing massive yields of overripe grapes. The other thing is that Fred Franzia is no dummy he planted those vineyards in such a way as the rows run north-south, giving the vines maximum sun exposure and he made the rows as long as he possibly could, minimizing the number of turns his tractors would need to make. And third, these aren't hand-picked vineyards ... they are all machine harvested. And that means these large tractors with huge claws go down the rows of vineyards grabbing the grapes and depositing them in its huge receptacle. And it not only grabs ripe grapes, but unripe and down right rotten ones as well and throws them all together. Add to that leaves, stems and any rodents, birds, or insects that may have made those vines their home they all get thrown into the bin as well. And guess what? You think there's going to be any sorting when that truck arrives at the winery (or should I say processing facility)? Nope. Everything, and I do mean everything (including all those unripe grapes, rotten grapes, leaves, stems, birds, rodents, and insects) gets tossed into the crusher and transferred to large tanks to ferment. So think about all the animal blood and parts that may have made their way into your wine next time you crack open that bottle of Two Buck Chuck! Hardly even seems worth the $2 does it? If you were to taste that wine right after it was made, I guarantee you it would be undrinkable. They will then manipulate the finished wine in whatever way necessary, including adding sugar or unfermented grape juice if needed to make the wine palatable. And then the wine goes into bottling, packaging and shipping facilities, all of which Fred Franzia owns himself. They then get put on trucks (also owned by Fred Franzia) and shipped to Trader Joe's. The only part of the process Fred doesn't own is Trader Joe's itself and I'm sure if he got his way, he'd include that in his empire as well. So the summary is this to make $2 wine one must compromise all sense of integrity and quality, own tens of thousands of acres of vineyards in the worst possible wine region possible where land is incredibly cheap and yields are exceptionally high, use machines to execute every part of a homogenized system that substitutes manipulation for hand crafted quality, and own every step of the winemaking process including bottling, packaging and distribution, all while giving the finger to the entire wine industry and plowing down anyone who gets in your way. According to a CNBC report on the controversy engendered when Knox's comments were widely republished three years later: Franzia does use mechanized harvesting, as do an increasing number of grape growers. He insists the machines shake loose everything but the grapes, and there are other methods along the way to filter out leaves, twigs and animal residue. \"We're in the grape-picking business,\" he said. \"We're looking for quality wines and quality grapes. We're not looking for animals.\" Some animal matter does end up in winemaking, as it does in almost all agricultural products. \"If you worry about things like that, you shouldn't eat anything, you shouldn't drink anything,\" Franzia said. \"When the wine's fermenting, they're going to eliminate anything that's possibly there.\" But what about this mysterious \"Charles Shaw\"? Was he a real person? Indeed he was. Shaw, a Stanford Business School graduate, bought a Napa winery with his wife, Lucy, in 1974 and began to produce Charles Shaw Beaujolais. However, after the Shaws divorced in 1991, they sold the winery. The Charles Shaw label possessed a good reputation, though, and Bronco Wine Co., a mass-market wine conglomerate located in the Central Valley's Stanislaus County, bought it up and revived it in 2002 for sales of a line of inexpensive wines through the Trader Joe's chain of grocery stores.

A 1948 ad touting the sturdiness of Springmaid's Fort Sumter sheets pictures a midnight swain scampering down the sheets let out his lady love's window as her father hacks away at them with a hatchet. Titled \"Bungled Bundling,\" the ad's copy culminates with \"No matter what you say or do, remember that in cold or heat, you can't go wrong on a Springmaid sheet.\" But it was the 1949 \"Buck well spent\" ad that raised the most eyebrows. The layout shows a sleeping native American man sprawled in an attitude of complete exhaustion in a sheet (which cost about a dollar back then) stretched hammock-style between birch trees. A comely young woman flashing a wide grin is getting up from the hammock, one leg still caught in its confines. Its caption reads \"A buck well spent on Springmaid Sheet.\" The now-infamous line was coined by Colonel Elliot White Springs, third president of Springs Cotton Mills. His ads gave Springmaid one of the highest brand recall ratings of that era, and sales of his company's product sloped up without interruption until his death in 1959. Springs Cotton Mills has since become Springs Industries. Its corporate headquarters are in Fort Mill, South Carolina, and it continues to use the Springmaid label. In 1998 it linked up with its past by once again producing risqu ads. In one, three colorful Springmaid towels hang on a wall; the caption below reads \"Snap butt with style.\" Others show pillows and ask the question, \"Why drool on something dull?\" The \"buck well spent\" ad wouldn't make it today, but not due to its frisky wordplay (although some would certainly object on that basis): \"buck\" is no longer a term considered suitable for use in connection with native Americans.

Told in their own words, it's a look back to a decade filled with heartbreak. Even so, many of the stories make us laugh, for humor is an integral part of the human spirit. It's to one of those \"I have to laugh so I don't cry\" stories that I now direct your attention: The slickers were a mile a minute, and everyone had a crack at taking the poor farmer. Here was one. Maybe you couldn't grow much, but with a little care you could grow potatoes and they'd help you get through the winter. Didn't the Irish live on them once, and even make their whiskey from them? You could get a binful, but you had to watch out for the bugs. The potato bugs. They could ruin you. There was this advertisement in a lot of the papers, the (Winnipeg Free Press) Prairie Farmer, the (Saskatoon) Western Producer, the farm papers and some of the others, and it advertised a sure-fire, quick-kill, instant, always ready potato bug killer. It never missed, and easy to use. Only $1.50 or $1.25. Even a child can use it, the ads said. Well, there wasn't a farmer who couldn't scrape up a dollar and a half to save his crop, and until the papers got wise and stopped their advertising they must have sold thousands, more than thousands. When it came, it was two pieces of wood, about half an inch thick and about the size of a pack of cigaret papers. About five cents worth of wood, I'd say. The instructions were simple too. Just go out into the potato patch, pick up a potato bug, put it on one piece of wood and slam the other piece of wood down hard. Goodbye, spud bug. They were right, of course, because it was deadly and sure-fire and even a kid could handle one, but somehow that wasn't the point. They sold an awful lot of them and it got to be a joke, even in the post office, where the postmaster, if a parcel was about the right size, would say, \"Okay, Joe, here's your sure-fire and deadly potato bug killer.\" Hell, in some ways it was worth a dollar and a half to get a laugh in those days. The tale pops up in another culture, this one to the south of the United States: This was a man who was reading a magazine, and he saw an ad, \"Send for a genuine Mexican coat hanger. Only five dollars.\" So he sent his five dollars, and pretty soon he got a package with the Mexican coat hanger. It was a rusty old nail.

Unfortunately, the game Nintendo head Hiroshi Yamauchi selected to spearhead the assault on the pockets of American youth was \"Radarscope,\" a dull \"shoot-down-the-airplanes\" effort that gathered far more dust than quarters. Even worse, Nintendo's development teams were busy working on other projects and couldn't be pulled away to try to salvage the fiasco. So, Yamauchi turned to a young artist named Shigeru Miyamoto, who had never designed a video game before, and tapped him to turn \"Radarscope\" into something profitable.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Instead of revamping \"Radarscope,\" Miyamoto instead created a new game from scratch, somewhat inspired by the tale of Beauty and the Beast . In Miyamoto's version, the beast was a giant ape who captured a young woman, and her carpenter boyfriend had to rescue her from his clutches by navigating the shell of an unfinished building while trying to avoid rolling barrels and other obstacles hurled by the enraged ape. Some Nintendo executives were skeptical that Miyamoto's new game would be an even bigger flop than \"Radarscope,\" but it proved a hit both in Japan and America, pulling in $100 million for Nintendo of America in its first year alone. Those of us who spent our after-school hours hanging around arcades in those days were intrigued by the new game's departure from the traditional \"shoot and destroy\" motif, its use of comical characters, and its distinctive music and sound effects. Few of us stopped to ponder why the game was called \"Donkey Kong\" when it featured no donkeys the name was euphonious enough, and . . . well, those Japanese had funny names for lots of things which didn't make any sense to us. Now that we're older and have the capacity to ponder weightier issues than we did back then, it's time to consider: Why was the game named \"Donkey Kong\"? The \"Kong\" part is obvious (giant ape = King Kong), but whence comes the \"donkey\"? We find that there are several competing alternatives to choose from, starting with the mistranslation theory: It seems the entire game is a misnomer. Legend has it that the Japanese wonk who developed the game made a mistake when translating the Japanese for \"Monkey Kong\" into English. By the time the error was discovered millions of labels had already been printed.1 Why exactly the giant ape is called \"Donkey Kong\" is a mystery, although I heard one story that sounds plausible: The original arcade game, designed in Japan, was supposed to be called \"Monkey Kong,\" but somebody misspelled it and the name stuck.2 Chalking up an unusual Japanese product name to a \"mistranslation\" is bound to be a popular explanation to anyone who's struggled with the often bewildering English instructions that accompany Japanese consumer electronics products, or who's tried to make sense of the lyric sheets provided with imported Japanese CDs. And even when Japanese product names are rendered in English in ways that correctly reflect the concepts their manufacturers wanted to express, they can still be rather awkward. (Even if it were obvious from the name that Pocari Sweat was a beverage that replenished what your body lost through physical exertion, who wants to drink something named for \"sweat\"?) However, chalking up the name \"Donkey Kong\" to a mistranslation is a rather dubious explanation. Confusing \"donkey\" and \"monkey\" could hardly be considered a \"translation mistake\" (especially since they're two quite different animals whose names aren't the least bit similar in Japanese). Nor does this seem likely to be the product of a spelling error, as the sounds represented by the letters \"d\" and \"m\" are distinctly different in both Japanese and English (and we'd have to believe that by an amazing coincidence, the translator misspelled \"monkey\" in just the right way to produce the name of another animal). At best, this is an error in orthography, one unlikely to be made by someone who wasn't already somewhat familiar with English. For example, I might confuse the Spanish words for \"duck\" and \"turkey\" (\"pato\" vs. \"pavo\") but only because I've learned enough Spanish to know these words in the first place (and even then, part of my difficulty in distinguishing these words would stem from the fact that they refer to somewhat similar animals). If I had any doubts or I didn't know these words in the first place a quick flip through an English-Spanish dictionary would easily set me right. According to Mark Smith, editor of the Club Nintendo magazine, the game should have been called Monkey Kong it did indeed feature a large gorilla, with nary a donkey to be seen but there was a typing error on a fax from Nintendo (Japan) to Nintendo.3 However, at some point prior to the release of this seminal video game featuring a bad-ass monkey and a squat Italian-American handyman, a blurred fax resulted in it forever being known as Donkey Kong.4 [Collected on the Internet, 2001] When Miyamoto talked to the American importers about the name of the game he had just created he said \"Monkey Kong\", but due to the bad phone line the Americans thought he said \"Donkey Kong\"; they liked the latter name better, so it stuck. These explanations aren't completely implausible, especially when you consider that the musical groups ELO and the Byrds ended up with improbably-titled albums because a phone message or form was misunderstood. Still, in the world of urban legendry, we're always skeptical when several similar explanations with slightly different details are offered for the same phenomenon. Did \"Monkey Kong\" become \"Donkey Kong\" because of a mistyped fax, a blurred fax, or a bad voice connection? It can't be all three. Yet another explanation is that the title wasn't the result of a mistake at all, but rather the product of the game designer's efforts to come up with a name that reflected the comic stubbornness of the main character: [Miyamoto] consulted a Japanese-English dictionary and found \"donkey\" listed as an English equivalent to the Japanese word for stupid or goofy. He decided that Kong would be a good name for the gorilla, so he called the game Donkey Kong.5 [Collected on the Internet, 2001] The word \"donkey\" is, given a poor grasp of english idiom, the opposite of the word \"king\" (etymology: donkey ass fool; fool is traditionally the opposite of king). The title \"Donkey Kong\" is supposed to be a clever pun, but it doesn't translate well. It also serves as a way to refer to the movie King Kong without violating copyright. These explanations aren't inherently implausible either (although they're probably a bit garbled, as it would be a bit unusual to find \"donkey\" listed as a synonym for \"stupid\" or \"goofy,\" as the former is a noun and the latter are adjectives), although some have dismissed them as face-saving tales concocted after the fact to cover up an embarrassing mistake. Nintendo was sued by MCA for infringing on \"King Kong,\" but they don't seem to have chosen the name \"Donkey Kong\" with the intent of avoiding copyright complications. (Miyamoto's himself said during the court trial that \"King Kong\" was considered a generic term in Japan for any large, scary ape, hence his use of \"Kong.\") The bottom line is that no evidence backs up any of the explanations that the name \"Donkey Kong\" came about because of a misread fax, mispronunciation, or mistranslation. Shigeru Miyamoto, the game's inventor and the one person who unquestionably knows the origins of the name he chose, has repeatedly affirmed that he used the word \"donkey\" to convey a sense of stubbornness and the name \"Kong\" to invoke the image of a gorilla.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links":

that can be found in hundreds (if not thousands) of books about marketing: General Motors introduced their Chevrolet Nova model of automobile into a Spanish-speaking market, then scratched their heads in puzzlement when it sold poorly. GM executives were baffled until someone finally pointed out to them that \"nova\" translates as \"doesn't go\" in Spanish. The embarrassed automobile giant changed the model name to the Caribe, and sales of the car took off.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "This anecdote is frequently used to illustrate the perils of failing to do adequate preparation and research before introducing a product into the international marketplace. It's a wicked irony, then, that the people who use this example are engaging in the very thing they're decrying, because a little preparation and research would have informed them that it isn't true. (The sources that repeat this little tale can't even agree on where the Nova supposedly sold poorly, variously listing locales such as Puerto Rico, Mexico, South America, or simply \"Spanish-speaking countries.\") This is another one of those tales that makes its point so well just like the apocryphal one about George Washington and the cherry tree that nobody wants to ruin it with a bunch of facts. Nonetheless, we're here to ruin it. The original Chevrolet Nova (initially the Chevy II) hit the U.S. market in 1962. (This car should not be confused with the smaller, front wheel drive vehicle which was produced in 1985 as a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota and also assigned the Nova name.) Between 1972 and 1978 the Chevrolet Nova was also sold in Mexico and several other Spanish-speaking countries, primarily Venezuela. Shortly afterwards the great \"Nova\" legend arose, a legend which a little linguistic analysis shows it to be improbable: First of all, the phrase \"no va\" (literally \"doesn't go\") and the word \"nova\" are distinct entities with different pronunciations in Spanish: the former is two words and is pronounced with the accent on the second word; the latter is one word with the accent on the first syllable. Assuming that Spanish speakers would naturally see the word \"nova\" as equivalent to the phrase \"no va\" and think \"Hey, this car doesn't go!\" is akin to assuming that English speakers would spurn a dinette set sold under the name Notable because nobody wants a dinette set that doesn't include a table. Although \"no va\" can be literally translated as \"no go,\" it would be a curious locution for a speaker of Spanish to use in reference to a car. Just as an English speaker would describe a broken-down car by saying that it \"doesn't run\" rather than it \"doesn't go,\" so a Spanish speaker would refer to a malfunctioning automobile by saying \"no marcha\" or \"no funciona\" or \"no camina\" rather than \"no va.\" Pemex (the Mexican government-owned oil monopoly) sold (and still sells) gasoline in Mexico under the name \"Nova.\" If Mexicans were going to associate anything with the Chevrolet Nova based on its name, it would probably be this gasoline. In any case, if Mexicans had no compunctions about filling the tanks of their cars with a type of gasoline whose name advertised that it \"didn't go,\" why would they reject a similarly-named automobile? This legend assumes that a handful of General Motors executives launched a car into a foreign market and remained in blissful ignorance about a possible adverse translation of its name. Even if nobody in Detroit knew enough rudimentary Spanish to notice the coincidence, the Nova could not have been brought to market in Mexico and/or South America without the involvement of numerous Spanish speakers engaged to translate user manuals, prepare advertising and promotional materials, communicate with the network of Chevrolet dealers in the target countries, etc. In fact, GM was aware of the translation and opted to retain the model name \"Nova\" in Spanish-speaking markets anyway, because they (correctly) felt the matter to be unimportant. The truth is that the Chevrolet Nova's name didn't significantly affect its sales: it sold well in both its primary Spanish-language markets, Mexico and Venezuela. (Its Venezuelan sales figures actually surpassed GM's expectations.) The whole \"Nova = \"doesn't go\" tale was merely another in a long line of automotive jokes, like the ones about \"Ford\" being an acronym for \"Fix or repair daily\" or \"Found on road dead\" or \"Fiat\" being an acronym for \"Fix it again, Tony!\" These humorous inventions might adequately reflect the tellers' feelings about the worthiness of various types of automobiles, but we don't really expect that anyone ever refrained from buying a Ford because he actually believed they needed to be repaired on a daily basis. The one bit of supporting evidence offered to back up this legend is spurious as well. General Motors, we're told, finally wised up and changed the model name of their automobile from Nova to Caribe, after which sales of the car \"took off.\" One small problem with this claim: the Caribe sold in Mexico was manufactured by Volkswagen, not General Motors. (The Caribe was the model name used by VW in Mexico for the car more commonly known in the USA as the Volkswagen Golf.) The Nova's model name was never changed for the Spanish-speaking market. The Chevy Nova legend lives on in countless marketing textbooks, is repeated in numerous business seminars, and is a staple of newspaper and magazine columnists who need a pithy example of human folly. Perhaps someday this apocryphal tale will become what it should be: an illustration of how easily even \"experts\" can sometimes fall victim to the very same dangers they warn us about.

In 1984, American Stores the parent company of Chicago-based Osco, a large drug store chain concentrated in the Midwestern and Eastern U.S. acquired Sav-On when it purchased Jewel. The Sav-On stores were incorporated into the Osco chain starting in 1986 and designated \"Osco / Sav-On,\" eventually dropping the \"Sav-On\" portion of its name.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Then the unexpected occurred. Sales were lower than anticipated at Sav-On stores in southern California and Las Vegas, and they began losing market share to competing drug chains. Within three years Osco announced that their 165 outlets in those areas would revert to using the original \"Sav-On Drugs\" name. What happened? Word around Los Angeles was that those Osco folks from the Midwest hadn't considered a factor of paramount importance in the heavily Hispanic southern California market: The name Osco has the same pronunciation as the Spanish word \"asco\" (oss-ko), which means \"disgust\" or \"loathing.\" Of course Osco's market share declined in California, know-it-all L.A. wags suggested, because how many Spanish-speaking people would want to purchase drugs and beauty aids from a store whose very name indicates repulsion? This, they claimed, was obviously the reason Osco changed the stores' names back to Sav-On. Osco's vice-president of administration, Alan Barker, maintained otherwise: There is no connection between that and the name change. I told that to another reporter, and it showedup as a \"no comment.\" I said this was a very exciting, very, very positive change for the company, and none of that showed up either. We are changing it back because customers recognize Sav-On from decades of operation. We're going to respond to what our customers recognize. The L.A. Times suggested there was a connection there, and it is nonsense. I don't know where people come up with that garbage. Was the unfortunate cross-language meaning the real reason for the name change? Probably not. Most likely it was another flavor of the infamous Chevrolet Nova legend, as others pointed out: It's just an amusing story, said Hector Marquez, professor of Spanish at the University of Redlands. He compared it to stories several years ago about the Chevrolet Nova. \"No va'' in Spanish can mean \"it doesn't go,'' but Marquez said any Spanish-speaking person would know better. \"People who study sales and advertising might have a different view,'' Marquez said. \"But from a language point of view, this sort of thing doesn't have an impact. I don't give much credibility to those stories.'' The underlying cause for the sales slump in the California and Las Vegas markets was probably attributable to a number of factors, but one of those factors was almost certainly a common business blunder: When you have a name that consumers know and trust, don't change it. As John Kosecoff, an analyst with First Manhattan Co. in New York noted, \"Sav-on has had a long-standing cachet in California. Its name is familiar. It has represented quality, local merchandising and good value for consumers.\" Another real-world example of the maxim, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.savon.com/;", "Example": "", "Last Updated": "13 May 2011", "Credibility": "false", "URL": "www.snopes.com/business/misxlate/osco.asp", "Claim": "Southern California Sav-On drug store outlets were renamed Osco after an acquisition, then reverted to the original Sav-On name when their parent company discovered \"asco\" means \"disgust\" or \"loathing\" in Spanish.", "Claim_ID": "business_misxlate_osco", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/business/misxlate/osco.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "bestcorey.blogspot.com", "link": "http://bestcorey.blogspot.com/2010/10/chapter-5-blog-response.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "bestcorey.blogspot.com", "link": "http://bestcorey.blogspot.com/2010_10_01_archive.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "bestcorey.blogspot.com", "link": "http://bestcorey.blogspot.com/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.namedevelopment.com", "link": "http://www.namedevelopment.com/blog/archives/2005/09/konglish_gives_korean_businesses_a_bad_name.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "web.mit.edu", "link": "http://web.mit.edu/~ecprice/Public/wordlist.ranked", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "web.mit.edu", "link": "http://web.mit.edu/adamrose/Public/googlelist", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "mit.edu", "link": "http://mit.edu/~ecprice/Public/freq/googlelist.counts", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "ftp.cs.princeton.edu", "link": "ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs226/autocomplete/words-333333.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "norvig.com", "link": "http://norvig.com/ngrams/count_1w100k.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "", "link": "/aclk?sa=L&ai=CorunK72jVtuBCoLzpAO61JXQDdHaubgGkcSsmCChz4Q9CAMQASgCYOUDyAEBqgQoT9CNqiRXlgwoJtxW1N0EEzLXVMrH9mbqOi4IW8UtuoFCYXSDi19KioAH0ZfiI5AHA6gHpr4b2AcB&sig=AOD64_0kIbk8YtafihJvyLagPBnRy6lSKQ&clui=0&q=&ved=0ahUKEwiO3-ypv8DKAhUMmoMKHetfDgMQ0QwIUQ&adurl=http://www.local.com/results.aspx%3Fkeyword%3Dsavon%2Bdrug%2Bstores%26cid%3D17180%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3DPharmacies/Drug%2520Stores%26utm_term%3Dsavon%2520drug%2520stores", "link_type": "ads_main"}, {"domain": "", "link": "/aclk?sa=L&ai=CoV4cK72jVtuBCoLzpAO61JXQDZ-ssNsE77HmqZ4Bz43_ioQCCAMQAigCYOUDyAEBqgQlT9CdtitXlQwoJtwe1GN4rfKV0Ly3xTfNOtEqi1oTSmLW_kdrDIAHl83_L5AHA6gHpr4b2AcB&sig=AOD64_1uAWHh80_66B_pXDoDTp_3TOvzJA&clui=1&q=&ved=0ahUKEwiO3-ypv8DKAhUMmoMKHetfDgMQ0QwIVw&adurl=http://us.wow.com/search%3Fs_pt%3Daolsem%26s_it%3Daolsem%26s_chn%3D71%26q%3Dcalifornia%2520sav%2520on", "link_type": "ads_main"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "norvig.com", "link": "http://norvig.com/ngrams/count_1w.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.etymologie.info", "link": "http://www.etymologie.info/~e/u_/us-diktio.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "lebret.ch", "link": "http://lebret.ch/embeddings/50/vocab.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "practicalcryptography.com", "link": "http://practicalcryptography.com/media/miscellaneous/files/english_counts2.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "web-ngram.research.microsoft.com", "link": "http://web-ngram.research.microsoft.com/info/bingbodyjun09_top100kwords.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "cis.legacy.ics.tkk.fi", "link": "http://cis.legacy.ics.tkk.fi/lkozma/nlp/train2.wfreq", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "cs.brynmawr.edu", "link": "http://cs.brynmawr.edu/Courses/cs325/fall2013/bigWordList.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "puzz.googlecode.com", "link": "https://puzz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/data/nutrimatic-100K.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "", "link": "/aclk?sa=L&ai=C0SvbLb2jVuGcH4KLpgPm-ofgD_L5jLUGuumGz4sCvdadudMBCAMQAWDlA5ABAsgBAaoEJE_QzXT1q7j41s4rib13VeJSEiFg2IDPagVX_SQhe2-l7fMvUYAHwrz7OZAHA6gHpr4b2AcB&sig=AOD64_0Uws1DC9Ph51W6QLNog6nAt-sQOg&clui=0&q=&ved=0ahUKEwjS3Pqqv8DKAhWmn4MKHfy5AOI4ChDRDAhB&adurl=http://us.when.com/vertical%3Fq%3Doutlets%2520stores%2520california%26type%3Dcontent%26s_pt%3Daolsem%26s_it%3Dcontent%26s_chn%3D1", "link_type": "ads_main"}]}]}, {"Origins": "If you've ever had call to withdraw a sum of money from the bank that was larger than you'd customarily handle, you may have experienced feeling a corresponding sense of foreboding until the currency was safely transported to its destination. It is often mused money is power; accordingly, being in possession of large sums of cash (for instances such as a private party car sale) can feel dangerous because it makes you a target of those who seek to acquire power. One of the most common tips bestowed upon travelers involves carrying as little currency as possible while away from home, so pervasive is our fear of being hoodwinked out of it when we're away from familiar places.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Moreover, the notion dealing in cash is a risky proposition is on the upswing. Credit and debit cards are now accepted nearly everywhere, and plastic offers formidable protection against being swindled or cheated out of everything you have. That's generally not the case with cash (which is far less frequently insurable): Even when we're being cautious, carrying a large sum of currency can feel like wearing a neon \"rob me\" sign; and were such a circumstance to come to pass, we'd expect to be asked with alacrity why it was necessary to be toting so much money around. Common discomfort over the handling of large sums of money has led to some near-superstitious beliefs about how to do so safely and legally, including a common rumor simply having cash totaling $10,000 or more in your possession is illegal regardless of how you acquired it or what you intend to do with it. A quick online search reveals a number of variations of this belief that are fairly persistent: it's illegal to carry any amount of cash over $10,000, you are prohibited from flying with sums of that amount, and even \"instruments\" (such as a check) over the magical $10,000 mark will provoke scrutiny and possible detention by law enforcement agents. No U.S. law specifically prohibits an individual from possessing or carrying $10,000 or more. In fact, it's not technically illegal to possess sums far larger than that for a wide variety of purposes. (If it were, many small business owners would find running their primarily cash-based businesses impossible.) However, a few factors advance the belief that $10,000 is a threshold of illegality when it comes to money. The most likely suspect is the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, also known as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Enacted to inhibit money laundering, and utilized by the United States Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the BSA mainly obligates banks (not citizens) to report transactions of more than $10,000: The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (which legislative framework is commonly referred to as the \"Bank Secrecy Act\" or \"BSA\") requires U.S. financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering. Specifically, the act requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, file reports of cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities. It was passed by the Congress of the United States in 1970. That legal requirement for banks' recording of cash transactions is invoked at the $10,000 mark, which has likely inspired the mistaken belief merely possessing that sum of money is illegal (while having $9,999.99 or less is perfectly within the bounds of the law). However, the BSA applies to \"financial institutions\" not individuals, and the $10,000 cash threshold is not the only element involved in reporting requirements. In addition to reporting cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (not just single transactions, but transactions conducted over the course of a day that collectively add up to $10,000 or more), banks are required to keep records of \"cash purchases of negotiable instruments\" and to report any \"suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities.\" That leads to another critical aspect of the \"legality of large sums of money rumor\": namely, there is no specific dollar amount that enables a person to safely stay off Uncle Sam's radar. Any evasive or seemingly secretive movement of money, in any amount, could trigger bank reporting and law enforcement scrutiny. A debate has long been underway about the circumstances under which the government may examine and even seize the property of American citizens under a collection of laws commonly described as \" Civil Asset Forfeiture .\" A variety of state and federal laws allow law enforcement agents to seize an individual's assets for a number of reasons, and critics of such laws assert reclaiming assets seized in such a fashion is next to impossible. The American Civil Liberties Union (who opposes the practice) described civil asset forfeiture on a page about the subject: Every year, federal and state law enforcement agents seize millions of dollars from civilians during traffic stops, simply by asserting that they believe the money is connected to some illegal activity and without ever pursuing criminal charges. Under federal law and the laws of most states, they are entitled to keep most (and sometimes all) of the money and property they seize. Some unwitting individuals have prompted such seizures by diligently avoiding the $10,000 threshold, believing doing so constituted adherence to the law. But deliberately ensuring that none of your transactions ever exceeds $10,000 can have the unintended side effect of provoking suspicion by creating the impression you are making efforts to avoid scrutiny. Thus, the intent of the BSA is much broader: the government isn't specifically focused on $10,000 but on keeping an eye on any transactions that may indicate a pattern of illegality (such as arms trade, drug sales, or other controlled dealings). In respect to travel, the $10,000 number is again codified in law. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) includes it in its guidelines for traveling with valuables and currency, but only as a requirement to report. The transport of more than $10,000 in American currency isn't expressly prohibited, but possession of such a sum must be reported to Customs by Americans who travel internationally: For international flights, you must report the transport of $10,000.00 USD or more to the U.S. Customs Service. Again, the $10,000 threshold is used as a barometer for reporting, but is not a dividing line between the legal and the illegal. In all the scenarios described, the possession of that specific amount of money (or more) is denoted as one that requires reporting and perhaps explanation when you and your money pass through official checkpoints. Notably, however, having a sum of $10,000 or more is not specifically illegal in any jurisdiction or under any law in the United States. You may legally store cash as you wish in your home and carry it with you in your travels, and if you're traveling privately you need not report the transport of your own money even if you carry $10,000 or more. However, if you are pulled over by a police officer with thousands of dollars in your vehicle, you may be asked to explain how and why you're carrying so much money (ostensibly to uncover the trafficking of drugs and other contraband). And in many cases, law enforcement agents can seize large sums of cash and insist you provide proof you acquired the currency legally and do not intend to use it for illicit purposes. Legal justification for seizing money in that scenario is broad and complex, making it risky (even if not technically illegal) to transport large sums of cash.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred

{"Origins": "So often those \"everybody knows\" facts we naively place reliance upon turn out to be embarrassingly false. Such is not the case here, in that there is some truth to the \"U.S. currency tainted by cocaine\" claim, but the implications of this conversation-stopping fact are far more mundane than we might initially presume. To put it another way, it's less shocking a fact than we first perceive it to be because the underlying assumption that every bill bearing traces of cocaine got that way through having been used to inhale lines of cocaine is false.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Contrary to our first thought upon encountering this interesting little fact, that trace amounts of cocaine turn up on approximately four of every five bills in circulation doesn't mean the now-contaminated currency was at one time used to snort coke or passed through the dope-laden paws of seedy characters. Rather, the drug is easily conveyed from one bill to another because cocaine in powdered form is extremely fine. (This point would have been much more difficult to explain prior to the anthrax mailings of 2001, but those deadly contaminations taught even the least drug-savvy among us how easily minute amounts of finely-milled substances can be transferred from one letter to another, even when the powder is contained within the envelope rather than lying on the surface.) When a cocaine-contaminated bill is processed through a sorting or counting machine, traces of the drug are easily passed to other bills in the same batch. ATMs serve to spread tiny amounts of cocaine to nearly all the currency they distribute, as do the counting machines used in banks and casinos. How widespread is the contamination? No one appears to have the definitive answer, as every study comes up with a different percentage. (For simplicity's sake, we'll say \"four of five\" throughout this article because that's the worst-case scenario, and the figure is representative of the results of some studies.) In one 1985 study done by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration on the money machines in a U.S. Federal Reserve district bank, random samples of $50 and $100 bills revealed that a third to a half of all the currency tested bore traces of cocaine. Moreover, the machines themselves were often found to test positive, meaning that subsequent batches of cash fed through them would also pick up cocaine residue. Expert evidence given before a federal appeals court in 1995 showed that three out of four bills randomly examined in the Los Angeles area bore traces of the drug. In a 1997 study conducted at the Argonne National Laboratory, nearly four out of five one-dollar bills in Chicago suburbs were found to bear discernible traces of cocaine. In another study, more than 135 bills from seven U.S. cities were tested, and all but four were contaminated with traces of cocaine. These bills had been collected from restaurants, stores, and banks in cities from Milwaukee to Dallas. A single bill used to snort cocaine or otherwise mingled with the drug can contaminate an entire cash drawer. When counting and sorting machines (which fan the bills, and thus the cocaine) are factored in, it's no wonder that so much of the currency now in circulation wouldn't pass any purity tests. The average person need not fear that the money in his wallet will inadvertently get him high, or that the act of paying for his burger and fries at McDonald's will cause him to fail a random drug test. Only those whose jobs call upon them to handle an extremely large number of bills every day need worry that enough cocaine is getting on their hands to be detectable. Bank tellers or those who work in the soft count rooms of casinos, for instance, might need to consider the effects of this contamination, but not average folks not even ones who occasionally carry a great deal of cash about their persons. As to how much cocaine will be on a contaminated bill, the expert witness in that 1995 court case charted results from as small as a nanogram (one-billionth of a gram) to as much as a milligram (one-thousandth of a gram). The Argonne National Laboratory study revealed that the average contamination was 16 micrograms (which is 16 one-millionths of a gram). If you're not quite sure how much a gram of cocaine is, picture the head of a thumbtack. These are very small amounts indeed, a fact that should be kept in mind as we speed off to share this startling new information about drugs on our money with friends and neighbors. This is not the latest, newest lurking danger to our health and welfare, nor is it an apocalyptic sign that drugs are taking over. Yes, drug use in our society is real, but it has yet to reach the proportions where four of every five bills in our wallets has been used to snort cocaine. That four of five bills might test positive only means that 80% of our paper money has at some time come into contact with contaminated bills or counting machines. It takes only one bill to contaminate hundreds or even thousands of others, so the number of bills that have actually come into direct contact with the drug trade is far smaller than we might first assume upon seeing that \"four of five\" claim marked as true.

(more commonly known as the dime) to honor 32nd President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died in office the year before at the beginning of his unprecedented fourth term. The front of the coin now bore a profile of Roosevelt with the letters 'JS' visible at the base of his neck. It wasn't long before rumors began to circulate that the reason for the presence of those letters was that they represented the initials of Soviet leader Josef Stalin. The rumors were completely spurious, of course: the letters 'JS' stood for the initials of the coin's designer, John Sinnock. Coincidentally, the next time a U.S. coin underwent a complete redesign to feature a fallen president (when Benjamin Franklin's portrait on the half dollar was replaced by President John F. Kennedy's in 1964), the change prompted similar rumors. In that case, initials found at the base of the profile a stylized rendition of the letters 'GR,' for designer Gilroy Roberts were claimed by some to be a surreptitious hammer and sickle.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Such was the climate of the Cold War era that rumors as absurd as these could gain prominence, even if few actually believed them.

The new $10 bill has prompted scores of complaints from Canadians who maintain that the poem has been misprinted; that the first line should be \"In Flanders fields the poppies grow .\" This, in turn, has led to rumors that the Bank of Canada is recalling the new notes in order to destroy them and replace them with corrected versions. As much as some of us want to believe the government would do something really dumb like issuing currency with a misprint of a very famous poem because they were too arrogant or lazy to actually read it first (and thereby created a potentially valuable collector's item), the truth is that the Bank of Canada got it right: The first line should indeed read \"In Flanders fields the poppies blow,\" although we're used to hearing it as \"In Flanders fields the poppies grow.\" The latter somehow sounds more \"right\" to us, perhaps because \"grow\" seems a better word to describe the stillness of a graveyard (although \"blow\" is used here to mean \"bloom\" rather than \"stirred by wind\"), and because \"grow\" echoes the final line \"We shall not sleep, though poppies grow, In Flanders fields.\" \"Grow\" has now supplanted the original \"blow\" in popular memory, in much the same way that Donner has come to be accepted as the name of one of Santa's reindeer. Still, as the Bank of Canada explained, they made diligent efforts to ensure that the poem was correctly reproduced on the new notes: Before incorporating this excerpt of the poem into the design of the note, the Bank consulted numerous references, and obtained the hand-written copy of John McCrae's poem which is stored in the National Archives of Canada. The handwritten manuscript of \"In Flanders Fields\" McCrae submitted to Punch magazine in 1915 confirms the correct phrasing, as does the reproduction on the poem on the web site of the McCrae House museum. Okay, so they got it right, and we've been getting it wrong all these years. Ick. The appeal of such a rumor isn't hard to understand we delight in the thought of the Government making an embarrassing mistake in the same way a child delights in a parent's pratfall. That in this case the pratfall didn't happen won't stop folks from whipping out the new $10 bills pointing to the \"error,\" and crowing about it.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links":

long had a \"silver\" dollar, the dollar hadn't seen much use as a circulated coin in the latter part of the 20th century; citizens of both countries greatly preferred their respective homelands' one-dollar banknotes. One-dollar bills, however, are now impractical when viewed from a cost-benefit basis: they wear out, necessitating replacement far more frequently than dollar coins would. Paper currency has a life expectancy of nine months, whereas coins are good for twenty years.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "In 1987 Canada's currency underwent a major change with the introduction of \"the loonie,\" that country's new gold-colored one-dollar coin. The loonie was created to replace the one-dollar bill, which was to be removed from circulation through attrition: worn-out dollar bills would continue to be destroyed, but no new stock of paper currency would take their place. Canadians were given one year to become accustomed to the metal dollar coin, then the Bank of Canada ended distribution of one-dollar banknotes, leaving the loonie supreme. Prior to 1987, Canada's silver dollar coin featured two men in a fur-laden canoe, a depiction of the voyageurs who had dared the wilderness in that country's early days. When Canada decided to replace one-dollar bills with one-dollar coins, the 1935 Emanuel Hahn \"voyageur\" design was adapted for the new coin, but something went awry the master dies of the new one-dollar coin were lost in transit. The dies, which had been produced in Ottawa, were being shipped to production facilities in Winnipeg. According to an investigation conducted by the Royal Canadian Mint, they had been entrusted to a courier service on 3 November 1986 and were never seen again. The dies' being sent by courier was in itself a breach of accepted security procedures (transport of the dies should have been handled by a high-security outfit such as Brink's), but there was more: no one had asked the courier company representative who had appeared to take possession of the package for identification. And both dies, the obverse and reverse of the new coin, had been bundled into the same shipment, meaning that whoever had the package also had the dies for striking both sides of the new coin. (The two sides should have been shipped separately to head off this possibility.) Although the Royal Canadian Mounted Police assert the dies were merely lost in transit, others believe they were stolen by folks intent upon minting their own money. With this possibility looming, the Mint undertook to redesign the coin to foil potential counterfeiters. They had an alternate Robert-Ralph Carmichael design featuring a loon on hand and quickly gained government approval for its use. Dies were cut, and the gold-colored dollars were loosed upon the Canadian public on 30 June 1987, meeting the schedule for the release date of the original \"voyageurs\" coin. The subject of the coin's design prompted its own nomenclature. Canadians quickly dubbed the new coin \"the loonie\" (a name has stuck through the years), and piggy banks became known as \"loonie bins.\" In 1996, the \"toonie\" joined the loonie in the pockets of Canadians as a new dual-metalled coin took the place of the two-dollar bill. Also known as \"the queen with the bear behind\" (Queen Elizabeth on one side, a bear on the other), the toonie gained its name from a combination of \"two\" and \"loonie.\" The loonie, by the way, might be gold colored, but it contains no gold. It is made of aureate bronze plated on pure nickel.

(The $20 will be issued in November 2012; the $10 and $5 will follow by the end of 2013.) These new bills should stand up to handling far better than their cotton predecessors (lasting up to 2.5 times longer, says the Bank of Canada) and prove quite difficult to counterfeit. Each costs 19 cents to make.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The new bills became the subject of gossip when tales of their melting into puddles of plastic circulated widely during the summer of 2012. A bank teller in Kelowna, British Columbia, said she'd heard of instances of $100s melted together when left inside a hot car. A man in Halifax, Nova Scotia, asserted he'd laid his wallet on a toaster oven after using that machine to brown a bagel, then noticed three of the new hundreds so warmed had taken on the appearance of a Coke bottle. \"Puddled\" currency tales began shortly after the new plastic $100s were released when a man in Cambridge, Ontario, reported his Christmas bonus of eight new $100 bills that he'd placed in a tin box near a heater had melted. Precious little can be manufactured in such a way as to render it entirely indestructible, and certainly anything fashioned of plastic will deform or even melt when subjected to a high enough heat. The new Canadian bills are made of polypropylene, a substance that has a melting point of 266 F. While they can melt if taken above that point, only rarely is a banknote likely to be in such an environment. The internal temperature of a car left parked with its windows up on a hot summer day isn't going to reach that level of sultriness the interior of one parked when the outside temperature is 90 F isn't typically going to go above about 140 F, which is well short of the requisite 266 F for deforming the new banknotes. Prior to their introduction, the new Canadian banknotes were subjected by the Bank of Canada to all manner of tests. They were boiled, frozen, and run through washing machines. They were subjected to rides in a tumbling mechanism filled with coffee grinds, marbles, bolts, and synthetic sweat (meant to simulate the effect of being left in a pocket). \"The new polymer notes have been rigorously tested in very hot (above 212 F) and cold (below -40 ) temperatures to ensure their durability,\" said Julie Girard, a currency spokesperson for the Bank of Canada to the Toronto Star . \"We put the notes in boiling water for over an hour and the notes retained their shape, size and properties, and could still be used as a means of payment.\" A representative of the Bank of Canada told us: These bank notes are among the most secure in the world and are the most durable bank notes ever issued by the Bank of Canada. They have been designed to ensure that they can withstand even the most demanding weather conditions we can experience here in Canada. This is straightforward, simple chemistry. We have done extensive and rigorous testing of these new polymer notes prior to issuing them, including exposing them to extremely hot (140 C / 284 F ) and cold (-75 C/ -103 F) temperatures. In other words, polymer bank notes cannot be affected by the types and levels of heat as has been suggested in recent news reports. Moreover, bank notes printed on polymer material have been used in many other countries for years; in places like Australia, Mexico, Nigeria and Singapore, all of which have climates far hotter than in Canada. More simply, if the person carrying the bills can stand the temperature, the bills he's carrying can take it as well. As for what to do when the inexplicable happens (i.e., one's hoard of cash ends up in a stove that is subsequently fired up), the Bank of Canada redeems damaged bank notes. And yes, people have seen their savings go up in smoke after leaving them in the oven, such as one man in Sydney, Australia who in July 2012 was out $15,000 after his wife (who \"never used it\") turned it on to heat up fish sticks for their kids. Canada has experienced its difficulties with currency revisions. A loon appears on its one-dollar coin in place of the traditional voyageur because the dies used to strike these coins were lost in transit, prompting a redesign. Its two-dollar bimetallic coin, the toonie, was discovered upon issue in 1996 to break apart when dropped, its aluminum-bronze center popping out from its nickel surround.

protecting the President and other assignees, this branch of law enforcement has a second area of responsibility, that of safeguarding the nation's money supply from counterfeiting. Indeed, the Service was begun in 1865 for that very purpose, because at the close of the Civil War counterfeiting was so commonplace that an estimated one-third to one-half of the currency then in circulation was fake. Protection of the President was added to the Service's duties only in response to the assassination of William McKinley in 1901.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "These days, the Secret Service's jurisdiction in the financial crimes arena has been expanded beyond the counterfeiting of U.S. currency into forgery, theft of U.S. Treasury checks and bonds, credit card fraud, telecommunications fraud, computer fraud, and identity fraud. The Secret Service routinely rounds up and jails counterfeiters. It also each year destroys millions of dollars of phony U.S. bills, many long before they are loosed upon the public. Theirs is a quietly efficient organization geared for success, with most of the operations undertaken unfolding with clockwork precision. But this is a tale of a counterfeiting investigation that went against that norm, as it unfolded with anything but clockwork precision. This one case bedeviled the Service for a decade and came to a close only through a series of fortuitous events rather than via dogged and effective police work. In New York City in 1938, very poorly executed counterfeits of dollar bills began appearing in that city's money supply. Turning up at a rate of no more than forty or fifty a month, these bogus bucks were produced on a small hand-driven printing press from a set of plates that could best be described as abysmally crude. And, as crude as they were, they got worse in subsequent editions as their maker sought to improve his product. One of the overhauls of his plates rendered the spelling of the surname of George Washington (whose portrait appears on the one dollar bill) as \"Wahsington.\" While the Secret Service was at that time routinely rounding up forgers who were doing far more damage to the money supply, they were baffled by this clumsy and unskilled counterfeiter. This hapless mystery man produced dollar bills and only dollar bills, and he never spread more than a handful of them in any given week. And he never seemed to pass his phony bucks more than once at the same place. The Secret Service dubbed him Mr. Eight Eighty, a moniker based on the file number assigned to his case. As the years passed, he came to be known as Old Mr. Eight Eighty, as his file maddeningly remained open while those of all others in its vicinity were closed, with the counterfeiters investigated in those cases being rounded up and jailed. For ten long and very frustrating years, Mr. Eight Eighty remained on the loose, his crudely rendered dollars surfacing in the New York money supply week after week. Attempting to collar him became a quest somewhat akin to the hunt for the Holy Grail for the Secret Service, because what had begun as little more than a lark had over the years escalated into a major manhunt as various agents assigned to the New York field office came to view this crossroader's continued lack of capture as their personal failure. The pursuit of Mr. Eight Eighty amounted to the most intensive manhunt in the history of counterfeiting up until that time, and it may still stand as a record. Whenever one of Eight Eighty's dollars surfaced, agents were dispatched to the business where it had been passed to question those working there about the person who might have given it to them. Time was also taken to educate shopkeepers about what to look for in spotting counterfeit currency, in hopes that if Mr. Eight Eighty came back, they'd make especial note of the person passing the bill then call the Secret Service with his description. Maps were dotted with push pins, each one serving to indicate the location of where a bill had appeared. However, such maps were hardly informative because while they did indicate the preponderance of the bills were surfacing in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the bills were also appearing all over the New York area and even well beyond. The region indicated by the cluster of push pins amounted to five square miles and contained a population of approximately a million people. Although the Secret Service hunted high and low, what eventually brought Mr. Eight Eighty to ground wasn't anything they did, but rather what fate did to the sought-after mystery man. In January 1948, fake dollar bills and a few printing plates were discovered in a garbage-strewn undeveloped lot near Broadway and Ninety-Sixth Street by a group of small boys playing there. The kids thought little of their find, and ten days went by before one of their fathers caught them playing poker among themselves with the funny money and turned it over to the local police precinct. A detective at that station telephoned the Secret Service about the cash and was floored at the reception provoked by what he'd thought was rather mundane news (fake dollar bills, after all). A group of Secret Service agents was there in a trice to examine the bills, confirmed that they were Eight Eighty's work, then paid a call on the man who'd turned in the false currency. Through him and his young son, they tracked the other children, finally locating the lads who had the plates in their possession. Another group of agents worked on the question of how the plates and the cash had come to be in a deserted lot. From those who lived nearby, they learned that a few weeks earlier there had been a fire on the top floor of a tenement overlooking the lot. They further learned that in an attempt to battle the blaze, the firefighters called to the scene had pitched a great deal of junk from the windows of a top floor apartment into the lot below. The occupant of that flat had not been at home at the time, although his aged mongrel had been, the dog expiring of smoke inhalation. A visit to that apartment settled all questions. In it, agents found the printing press, a pile of Eight Eighty's famed dollars, and even a drawerful of misprints. They also found Mr. Eight Eighty. The mystery man, the subject of the large and relentless decade-long manhunt, was 73-year-old Emerich Juettner, better known as Edward Mueller, a senior citizen who had given up his job as an apartment superintendent in favor of becoming a junkman after his wife died. The dollars he printed and put into circulation spelled the difference between his being able to support himself and his dog and not being able to make ends meet. Mueller, a likeable and otherwise upstanding man, was charged with counterfeiting and sentenced to a year and a day in jail, but his term was knocked down to four months behind bars. Up until his arrest, neither his son nor his daughter had any idea of what their father had been up to or that he'd been in financial distress. The old man had valued his independence to the point of preferring to engage in a life of crime rather than turn to his children for help, children it appears who would have been all too willing to help their aging father. It took ten years to catch the likeable old codger not because the Secret Service was inept in its pursuit of Mr. Eight Eighty, but rather because three factors inherent to the case worked against it, two having to do with Mueller's behavior and one with the denomination of the bill he chose to forge. Due to a peculiar turn of ethics, Mueller deliberately did not pass his fake bills at establishments more than once, for the express purpose of limiting the shortfall he caused any one person to no more than a single dollar. Instead of bilking the same places time and again, he spread his bogus bucks far and wide, thereby inadvertently avoiding one of the traps the Secret Service usually has going for it. Typical counterfeiters carelessly repeat their paperhanging at establishments already visited, and proprietors who have previously been burned by accepting fake bills tend to be far more observant afterwards of the currency handed to them and the people from whose hands it comes. The proprietors he left in his wake were rendered suitably alert to any future finagles, but because Eight Eighty didn't retrace his steps, the quarry they hunted never came back into their range. Also, Mueller was unnaturally frugal in his bilking of others; he never put more of his fake dollars into circulation than he needed to augment his meager earnings and provide himself and his dog with enough to live on. Typical counterfeiters are greedy, dumping large amounts of bogus cash at locations that are close together within a short span of time, thus greatly increasing the chances that someone so swindled will remember what they look like. For example, a fellow seeking to unload a sizeable wad of phonies may well paper every business establishment along a street, all within the space of one afternoon; while any one shopkeeper might not remember what the fellow who spent $500 in counterfeit bills looked like, among a whole street of defrauded businesspeople at least a few will likely produce a very good recollection of the man's appearance. Mueller was further protected by the denomination of the bill he forged. As amply demonstrated by the following trailer for the 1950 film Mister 880 that was based on this case, people pay precious little attention to the small denomination bills passed to them. As a general rule of thumb, as the value of the bill increases, so does the amount of scrutiny it is subjected to. A dollar bill, therefore, is barely glanced at, if at all: Mister 880 starred Burt Lancaster as the Secret Service agent in charge of the investigation and Edmund Gwenn, now best remembered as the Santa in Miracle on 34th St., as the counterfeiter.

big, bad corporate world by hiding subversive little images in advertisements and product packaging, and even in innocuous children's fare such as animated Disney films. So what could be more delightful than discovering that someone had pulled this prank on the biggest, baddest, corporate entity of them all, the Federal government? And even better, that the hidden message wasn't tucked away in some obscure government publication where hardly anyone would even have the chance to see it, but was part of something millions of people routinely handled every day, a piece of U.S. currency?", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "In 1928 the United States Treasury introduced a new $10 Federal Reserve Note bearing a portrait of Alexander Hamilton on the front and a depiction of the U.S. Treasury building on the back: Many years later, wags began to claim that the automobile shown driving past the Treasury building on the right-hand side of the foreground was a Model T Ford, and that close inspection of the image with a magnifying glass or microscope would reveal that the driver and passenger of this car were none other than infamous Depression-era crime duo Bonnie and Clyde! Hee hee! Gangsters pictured on a piece of U.S. currency. Driving right past the Treasury, no less. And the government never even realized it. Oh, the irony! As much as we appreciate the gag, this rumor is, in a word, silly. First of all, the inclusion of Bonnie and Clyde on a bank note designed in 1928 would have required the skills of a psychic or a time traveler, as Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker didn't meet until 1930 (and they weren't linked together in crime until 1932). Secondly, close inspection of this image reveals that it lacks sufficient detail to allow one to even determine whether the occupants of the automobile are male or female, much less identify them as specific individuals: Moreover, the car pictured on the back wasn't a Model T Ford, or any other particular make and model of automobile, as the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing noted: The engraved die of the Treasury Building vignette was completed in the early part of December 1927. The engraver was Louis S. Schofield. There are four cars included in this vignette. These cars are of no specific make or model and each one is a creation of the designer who prepared the original model which was later used by Mr. Schofield when he made the original hand-engraved die of this vignette. It would not be possible to have specific makes of automobiles engraved on the Treasury vignette for the $10 bill, which would be a composite model, without making it appear that we were sponsoring the product of one or another automobile manufacturer. Legal requirements will not permit a government agency to indicate its endorsement of a commercial firm or product. The four automobiles engraved into this design are similar in appearance to various models of cars being manufactured at that time. However, again, the cars in the design are of no specific make or model. The \"Model T Ford\" rumor probably developed separately from the \"Bonnie and Clyde\" rumor, with the former coming about simply because the Model T is the epitome of the \"old-time automobile,\" and the tiny image does look somewhat like the outline of a Model T (although others have maintained that it more closely resembles a Hupmobile ). Either way, the depiction of a Model T (which went out of production just before the $10 bill was introduced) wouldn't be appropriate for Bonnie and Clyde. Clyde Barrow certainly appreciated Ford automobiles, but he preferred something peppier than the Model T. None of these automobiles is present in the new design for the $10 bill which was introduced in 2000 and features a different, head-on view of the U.S. Treasury building on the reverse (although many of the older bills remain in circulation):", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links":

this one had been around when I was a kid so I have could pointed my father toward it and told him to shut up already. I can't recall how many times he solemnly intoned that \"Pennies are not legal tender in quantities greater than 100\" and therefore merchants were \"legally\" allowed to refuse any offer of payment that included more than one hundred one-cent coins (and, presumably, could not \"legally\" refuse payment offered in any other form of legal tender). As with so many other things he was dead wrong (and I knew it even then), but I had no way of proving him wrong. I can now, though.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Title 31 ( Money and Finance ), Subtitle IV ( Money ), Chapter 51 ( Coins and Currency ), Subchapter I ( Monetary System ), Section 5103 ( Legal Tender ) of the United States Code states: United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts. What this statute means, in the words of the United States Treasury, is that \"[A]ll United States money ... is a valid and legal offer of payment for debts when tendered to a creditor. There is, however, no Federal law mandating that a person or organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods and/or services.\" In other words, U.S. currency and coins can be used for making payments, but merchants do not necessarily have to accept it for all forms of business transactions. If a shoemaker wants to sell his products for 8000 jelly beans per pair, he's entitled to do so; the buyer cannot demand that he accept the equivalent value in legal tender instead. However, legal tender is the default method of payment assumed in contractual agreements involving debts and payments for goods or services unless otherwise specified. So, for example, if an automobile dealer signs a contract agreeing to sell you a car for $8,000, but when you begin making monthly payments he rejects them and insists he wants to be paid in gold instead, you can go to court and have your debt discharged on the grounds that valid payment was offered and refused. Up until the late 19th century, pennies and nickels weren't legal tender at all. The Coinage Acts of 1873 and 1879 made them legal tender for debts up to 25 cents only, while the other fractional coins (dimes, quarters, and half dollars) were legal tender for amounts up to $10. This remained the law until the Coinage Act of 1965 specified that all U.S. coins are legal tender in any amount. However, even in cases where legal tender has been agreed to as a form of payment, private businesses are still free to specify which forms of legal tender they will accept. If a shop doesn't want to take any currency larger than $20 bills, or they don't want to take pennies at all, or they want to be paid in nothing but dimes, they're entitled to do so (but, as mentioned earlier, they should specify their payment policies before entering into transactions with buyers). Businesses are free to accept or reject pennies as they see fit; no law specifies that pennies cease to be considered legal tender when proffered in quantities over a particular amount.

different U.S. state Each of the fifty designs is crafted to provide a symbolization of the individual state it represents, and the quarters introduced into the money supply in the order the states were admitted to the union.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Collecting fever ran high for the first few issues of these new coins, but as the years passed the demand for the annual offering of five new state's quarters has dropped off. However, a 2005 event has served to spur interest in at least one of these coins, if not the entire series. An aberration has been noted on some of the Wisconsin quarters struck at the Denver Mint: some of these coins sport an extra leaf on the ear of corn displayed on its flip side. (Wisconsin's design depicts an agricultural theme featuring a cow's head, a hunk of cheese, and an ear of corn.) Among the 453 million Wisconsin quarters minted over a two-week period near the end of 2004, a few thousand bearing a cornstalk peculiarity have surfaced. On some of the variant coins, an extra leaf on the ear is turned up; on others, the leaf is noticeably fatter than its siblings and points downward. While a benchmark value for these monetary units has yet to be established among collectors, prices paid so far have varied from approaching $100 to (in one isolated case) $1,499 by a Tucson dealer for a preeminently fine specimen. Keeping in mind the wide range of prices these coins have been vended for, in general one finds that individual Wisconsin anomalies are fetching somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 apiece for those reselling them, with three-coin sets of a regular Wisconsin quarter and one each of the two \"error coins\" bringing $1,100. Therefore, while a decidedly pleasant and somewhat monetarily enriching experience, happening upon one of these unusual coins in your pocket change will not be a life-altering event of the \"just won the lottery\" magnitude. You are also unlikely to encounter one of these finds unless you live in Tucson, where it is estimated about 5,000 of them have turned up. (Another fifty have been found in San Antonio.) As to how the extra-leafed coins came to bear images different from the official die the Wisconsin quarters were to be struck from, this altered artwork appears to have been a deliberate act on the part of an unknown employee of the U.S. Mint. Numismatic experts believe the additional leaves were not the result of misstrikes of the official die, but of strikes made with altered dies. What prompted the alteration is as yet unexplained. One theory speculates a Mint employee intent upon making his fortune from the sale of these unusual coins was responsible, yet that hypothesis seems to fly in the face of how coins are handled subsequent to manufacture. After the coins are stamped, they are shipped under heavy guard from the Mint to contractors who put them into paper or plastic rolls before sending them to banks, so the one who struck them would have had little, if any, chance of knowing where the altered quarters were being sent. Another theory again assigns blame to an unknown Mint employee but removes the profit-seeking angle: it asserts the mystery engraver was a worker with a grudge. Or he was someone bored with his day who looked to liven things up. Or he just wanted to see if he could do it, with the \"it\" being either producing an altered MInt-quality die or sneaking defective quarters past the system. Of this incident, the U.S. Mint Office of Public Affairs in Washington, D.C. said in a press release: \"The United States Mint is looking into the matter to determine possible causes in the manufacturing process.\" Barbara \"cache assets\" Mikkelson", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "", "Example": "", "Last Updated": "16 May 2011", "Credibility": "true", "URL":

"It's difficult to maintain a national identity in a country where nearly all of the inhabitants live within a few miles of the USA, so you can hardly blame Canadians for sometimes feeling that Americans are infiltrating every last aspect of their culture. A tangible expression of this feeling occurred during the 1980s, when every time the Bank of Canada introduced currency with new designs, somebody managed to find American flags hidden in the artwork.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The fun began with the introduction of a new $5 bill in May 1986: In spite of all the careful planning that went into the creation of the new $5 bill introduced last May, no one at the Bank of Canada foresaw the controversy that would be created by the flag flying above the Parliament buildings on the note. Since May, the Bank of Canada has issued repeated denials over allegations that the flag is not the Canadian flag or that it is the American flag. The matter of the flag on the $5 bill was the subject of considerable discussion in the House of Commons before the summer break. During the June 17 debate on the introduction of Canada's new $1 coin, John Nunziata, the member for York South-Weston, told Parliament that he had received a call from a very concerned citizen who had been examining the note and thought that the flag flying over the Parliament buildings was not the Canadian flag as we know it. \"There was a concern,\" said Nunziata, \"that it might in fact have been the American flag flying over the old Parliament buildings. We considered this to be an item of national concern so we pulled out the magnifying glass and took a very close look ... \" What Nunziata (and others) found with their magnifying glasses was that the flag flying over the centre block of the Parliament buildings was not an American flag, but the Red Ensign (which, although it was never Canada's official flag, served as Canada's recognized flag before being replaced by the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965): The introduction of a new $2 bill in September 1986 brought claims that it, too, depicted an American flag flying over Parliament (a claim which continues to circulate widely on one of those ubiquitous Internet lists of unusual \"facts\"), but as the inset in the image below shows, the flag in question is clearly Canada's current national flag, the Maple Leaf Flag: Three years later, when the Bank of Canada introduced a new $10 bill, the same old rumor was trotted out yet again (perhaps spurred by the implementation of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement earlier that year): Canada's new $10 bill must be immediately withdrawn from circulation because it carries a subliminalmessage to persuade Canadians to join the United States, a group opposed to free trade maintains. The message is in the flag behind Sir John A. MacDonald's head, said David Mayor, spokesman for Survival Canada. The group believes the tiny flag on the new bill which came into circulation June 27 was deliberately designed to resemble the stars and stripes of the American flag. \"Next thing you know, we'll be the 51st star on the American flag,\" Mayor said. \"Nothing should be flying above Parliament besides the Canadian red maple leaf flag.\" This one does look quite a bit like an American flag at first glance, but the crest (the dark spot in the lower right-hand corner) gives it away as the Red Ensign again: Frightened Americans used to look for Soviet Communists under their beds. Who'd have thought Canadians would top that by looking for American flags over their Parliament?", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "", "Example": "", "Last Updated": "1 July 2014",

the same in appearance for nearly seventy years, all U.S. currency (except the $1 and $2 bills) has undergone significant design changes since 1996. The $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills were all reissued between 1996 and 2000 with new designs implemented to incorporate advanced counterfeit-deterring security features, and the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing announced plans to undertake new designs every 7-10 years to stay ahead of currency counterfeiters. Accordingly, starting in 2003, the $10, $20, and $50 bills were redesigned a second time, in this case adding (among other features) subtle background colors to both deter counterfeiting and make the denominations more visually distinctive.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Keeping up with the dates of all these currency changes is not so straightforward, however. Unlike U.S. coins, each of which bears a year indicating when that particular coin was minted, U.S. currency features something known as \"series dates.\" A series date does not indicate the year a particular bill was printed, but rather the date of the design featured on that bill. That is, if the $5 bill were redesigned in 1929, all subsequent $5 bills issued using that design would be marked \"Series 1929,\" regardless of when they were actually printed. (When a minor change is made to a bill's features such as a substitution of signatures due to the appointment of a new Treasurer of the United States or Secretary of the Treasury the series year remains the same, but a letter is appended to it. Thus a minor change to \"Series 1929\" currency would result in bills marked \"Series 1929A.\") Small wonder, then, that some people assumed the 2006 release of newly-redesigned $10 bills bearing a legend reading \"Series 2004\" was the product of some sort of printing error: The series date isn't an error, though. Although the most recent re-designs of the $10, $20, and $50 bills were authorized for 2004, the release of the denominations incorporating these new designs was (as in the previous wave of currency re-designs in 1996-2000 ) staggered across several years. Thus, although all three denominations bearing the latest designs are technically \"Series 2004\" bills, the newest $20 bills were first put into circulation at the end of 2003, the new $50 bill was first released at the end of 2004, and the new $10 bill wasn't issued until March 2006.

envelope, and send it to them at an address in Los Angeles. They did so secure in the belief that encasing the money in foil would prevent its detection by law enforcement as it made its way to them.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "This story has a happy ending, in that the money was not sent directly to the swindlers but rather to a woman they had duped into being their intermediary via the reshipper scam. When contacted by the person defrauded, that other victim promised to return the cash, minus a hundred dollars. Which she did. What brings this tale of fraud averted into the realm of contemporary lore is the swindlers' belief that enrobing the large number of bills in aluminum foil would shield the cash from detection by any scanning device the package was passed through on its trip. In this, they engineered a mishmash composed of a pair of false beliefs already present in the canon of urban folklore plus a bit of actual truth from the realm of technology. First is the widespread belief that U.S. currency contains a hidden feature that makes it detectable by the government. That secret element is present, supposedly, to help the Feds pick up on large sums of American cash being moved in and out of the country, plus serves as a way for law enforcement to pinpoint those carrying large amounts of cash on their persons who are therefore likely to be engaged in illicit activities. While it is true U.S. currency contains a number of security features, including an embedded polyester strip within each larger denomination bill, those components serve to thwart counterfeiters and nothing more. Nothing about any of those anti-counterfeiting details works any sort of magic that would allow Uncle Sam to count the money in your pocket. (We cover this belief in greater detail in another article on this site.) Second is the long-held notion that tinfoil will defeat radar scanners. Many a speedster has festooned his car's aerial or sheathed his jalopy's hub caps in aluminum foil in the belief that by so doing he was rendering his roadster unreadable by radar guns. According to this bit of lore, the foil would serve to scramble or deflect the signal being aimed at it. Yet despite the number of folks who place their trust in this homespun solution to speeding tickets, the foil works no better at sandbagging the police than does hanging a pair of fuzzy dice from one's rearview mirror; that is to say, not at all. (Another article on our site discusses this belief further.) Finally, there is a bit of truth about tinfoil's having some use in shielding financial instruments from being read or detected, but those items are ones containing RFID chips, which U.S. currency does not. Shoplifters have in the past made off with large amounts of swag by stuffing items being purloined into foil-lined bags - once in such enclosures, the anti-theft devices attached to the goods being stolen did not trigger the alarm at the store's exit. Also, some debit and credit cards are \"skimmable\" (capable of having the financial information they contain read and recorded by thieves) even when sitting in one's pocket thanks to their RFID chips. To counter this possibility, some folks have taken to carrying these cards in wallets lined with aluminum foil. And yes, this does at least somewhat work.

Such was the case when in April 2010 rumors circulated that some of the Canadian $2 coins (toonies) then in circulation were counterfeits easily identifiable by the size of the Queen's portrait thereon.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The toonie is a bi-metallic $2 Canadian coin that bears an image of a polar bear on one side and that of Queen Elizabeth II on the other. (Which is why the joke of the moment when they first appeared in 1996 was to dub them \"the Queen with the bear behind.\") The April 2010 counterfeit rumor asserted that the telling clue regarding the genuineness of any suspect toonie was to be found in the engraving of the Queen borne on their obverse sides. Said the wisdom of the moment, the fakes sported a larger than usual portrait of her, plus she appeared in it lacking a crown. One was advised by this rumor to dump these coins because they were worthless. Whether this alert was meant in good fun or was sincere, the coins it pointed to as fakes were in fact the real thing. According to the Royal Canadian Mint (the Crown Corporation responsible for the minting and distribution of Canada's circulation coins), since 2003 all toonies have been struck with a new uncrowned effigy of the Queen that is larger than the crowned one that appeared on toonies made from 1996 to 2002. The Royal Canadian Mint issued this statement about the rumor: Since 1996, Canadian two-dollar circulation coins have been produced with two different images of the Queen: a smaller crowned portrait (from 1996 to 2002) and a larger uncrowned portrait introduced in 2003 to update the image of Her Majesty on all Canadian coinage. This last effigy has appeared on all Canadian circulation coins (one-cent, five-cent, 10-cent, 25-cent, 50-cent, one-dollar and two-dollar denominations) produced since June 2003. All circulation coins bearing these effigies are genuine and are to be accepted as legal tender in Canada. If, for any other reason, there is suspicion of a non-genuine coin, Canadians are encouraged to contact their local law enforcement authorities. As the Queen has aged, the engravings of her image used on coins and paper money have been updated, both in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Interestingly, a similar rumor spread in the UK regarding its 2 coins following their issue in June 1998, because on some of these [then] new coins, the Queen appeared wearing a necklace, but on others she didn't. Both versions of 2 coins were valid, just some had been minted using the Raphael Maklouf portrait of her common to all UK circulating coins between 1985 and 1997, whereas others bore the 1998 Ian Rank-Broadley portrait. In addition to the \"Watch out for these fake coins!\" tale, the UK 2 coins attracted a rumor that the ones bearing an engraving of the Queen in which she was wearing a necklace were especially valuable and that collectors of rare coins would pay dearly for them. Alas, that was but wishful thinking as The Royal Mint says of that rumor, \"Since millions of the 1997 2 coins were issued, there is no reason to believe that these coins are particularly rare.\" Barbara \"the origin of the specie\" Mikkelson Additional information: Are Two Dollar Bills Unlucky?

turning up a rare old coin worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars perhaps through discovering one stashed away by a relative who has forgotten about it, uncovering one hidden beneath some dirt or debris, or simply finding one in a handful of change. The last of these routes rarely yields lucky finds anymore, as collectors and treasure-seekers have long since plucked every coin of significant value from circulation, but in April 2006 the odds of making such an advantageous discovery got a little bit better.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "To help introduce more people to \"the magic of coin collecting,\" Scott A. Travers, a 44-year-old former vice president of the American Numismatic Association and author of The Coin Collector's Survival Manual, decided to mark National Coin Week in mid-April 2006 by deliberately spending three valuable old pennies as he made routine purchases around Manhattan. \"I'm planting a seed, and I hope that a new generation of people will come to appreciate the history that coins represent,\" he said. The three coins Scott Travers spent were all relatively low-mintage U.S. one-cent pieces nearly one hundred years old: a 1908-S Indian Head cent, and 1909-S VDB and 1914-D Lincoln cents. (In the conditions released by Travers, at the time those coins were worth roughly $200, $1,000, and $300, respectively.) Mr. Travers said he put the 1914-D Lincoln cent into circulation on 12 April 2006 when he purchased a pretzel from a food stand outside the NASDAQ offices in Times Square, and a few days later he spent the 1909-S V.D.B. Lincoln cent to buy a bottle of water from a different vendor in Times Square, then walked a block to a newsstand where he used the 1908-S Indian Head cent. Within a few weeks, seven people came forward saying they had found the $1,000 coin (i.e., the 1909-S V.D.B. Lincoln cent), but Travers said that although the proffered coins were real, none of them was the one he released into circulation. As of 2009 there had been no reports of anyone's finding any of the three rare pennies, but Scott Travers may never find out what happened to them, as it's quite possible the valuable cents ended up lost, squirreled away as oddities by people who didn't know their true value, or retrieved and sold by lucky finders unaware the coins were deliberately placed into circulation. Indeed, Mr. Travers has tried the same stunt more than once, and he hasn't ever learned the fate of some of the valuable coins involved in those previous attempts: Travers has spent rare coins before. In 1999, he did it to coincide with the numismatic association's convention in New York, although he never found out whether one of the rare pennies was rediscovered. Past coin drops, in 1997 and 2002, succeeded in sparking interest in coin collecting, but Travers doesn't know if anyone \"cashed in\" by finding the coins. Travers has met many people who believe they've discovered his coins, and though they may have found valuable coins, they weren't his.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.coinfacts.com/small_cents/lincoln_cents/wheat_ear_cents/1914d_cent.htm;http://www.coinfacts.com/small_cents/lincoln_cents/wheat_ear_cents/1909s_vdb_cent.htm;http://www.coinpage.com/coin-image-4839.html;", "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, 2006] A friend told me that she heard that a millionnaire put a penny worth a million dollars in circulation by using it to buy a hot dog at a vendor cart.

"Many of the items covered on our site exemplify the notion that we human beings don't like things that don't make sense, but we really do like interesting stories. So much so, in fact, that we'll invent and cling to fanciful, fictitious explanations that seem more satisfying or understandable to us than mundane realities, even when the subject is as trivial as candy bars.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "It's easy to see why some people might puzzle over the name of Mars' 3 Musketeers candy bar: Theconfection has no obvious connection to the literary creations of Alexandre Dumas (especially now that representations of the Three Musketeers characters are no longer featured on the bars' wrappers), and name isn't reflective of any quality of the candy itself. Its sibling bar, Milky Way, would seem to fit the name better, consisting as it does of three primary components: chocolate-malt nougat, caramel topping, and a chocolate covering. (The 3 Musketeers bar boasts a mere two components: fluffy chocolate nougat with a chocolate covering.) Hence a simple theory to explain it all: The bars are both misnamed because their wrappers were inadvertently switched when they were first introduced, and by the time the mistake was discovered it was too late for their manufacturer to feasibly switch them back. The obvious death knell to this explanation is that the 3 Musketeers and Milky Way candy bars were not \"released on the same day,\" or even in the same decade: Frank C. Mars introduced the Milky Way bar in 1923, but his Mars Company didn't begin producing 3 Musketeers bars until 1932. The specific answer to why the 3 Musketeers bar is so named has to do with the fact that it was once a considerably different type of confection. When first introduced in the 1930s, 3 Musketeers was not (as it is now) a single chocolate bar; rather, the wrapper housed three separate bars, each with a different flavor of fluffy, milk chocolate-covered nougat: one vanilla, one chocolate, and one strawberry. Eventually the vanilla and strawberry bars were dropped, and 3 Musketeers became a single chocolate bar. By the way, the Milky Way candy bar's name was not derived from the galaxy that is home to our solar system, as many assume: instead, the confection was formulated to replicate the taste of a malted milk shake and was therefore named after a drink of that nature that was popular in the 1920s. The Milky Way was originally sold in two flavors, chocolate nougat with milk chocolate coating and vanilla nougat with a dark chocolate coating, but eventually the former became the sole Milky Way bar and the latter was repackaged as Forever Yours.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.candyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-18-at-10.56.19-AM.png;http://www.milkywaybar.com/;http://www.3musketeers.com/;", "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, 2006] Someone told me a story about the origin of the names of Milky Way and 3 Musketeers bars. The legend goes that Milky Way and 3 Musketeers were released on the same day, but the labels were accidentally switched. This has a strain of plausibility, because a Milky Way bar has three ingredients (to review: chocolate coating, nougat, caramel), and it is easy to envision the smooth chocolate nougat interior of the 3 Musketeers bar as a veritable galaxy of taste. So, the labels were switched, and both bars were so popular, the candy company couldn't very well reverse themselves and change the names back after they were such a hit.
