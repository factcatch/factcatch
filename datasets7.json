[{"Origins": "In August 2015, a survey scam promising customers $100 off \"Back to School\" coupons for the Meijer hypermarket chain began circulating online: The $100 Meijer coupon scam is very similar to other schemes aimed at defrauding the customers of Target, Publix, Kroger, and Home Depot, all of which redirect users to a web site where they are asked to like, share, and/or comment on the coupons, ensuring that the scams get passed around social media:", "Fact Check": "Is Meijer offering $100 off \"Back to School\" coupons?", "Description": "While each of these scams feature slight variations, they typically redirect users to survey sites where they are asked to provide personal information such as e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, and credit card numbers. The Better Business Bureau offers these three tips to identify scams on Facebook: Don't believe what you see. It's easy to steal the colors, logos and header of an established organization. Scammers can also make links look like they lead to legitimate websites and emails appear to come from a different sender. Legitimate businesses do not ask for credit card numbers or banking information on customer surveys. If they do ask for personal information, like an address or email, be sure there's a link to their privacy policy. Watch out for a reward that's too good to be true. If the survey is real, you may be entered in a drawing to win a gift card or receive a small discount off your next purchase. Few businesses can afford to give away $50 gift cards for completing a few questions.

caption vaguely describing a pizza challenge was circulated on social media sites. According to rumors, the upfront cost for participating in the contest (purportedly $218) was steep, but participants were eligible for a refund and a $1,000 bonus if they consumed the entire pizza within a given timeframe (two hours, according to the meme). The pizza depicted is indeed a real menu item offered at Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria, a Southern California pizza chain.

We reached out to Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria's corporate offices to determine whether circulating claims about the pizza challenge were true, and according the company the pizza challenge as described in the meme is mostly accurate. Of the twenty Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria locations in Southern California, five currently possess the capability to serve the giant Sicilian pie, and the challenge is most commonly undertaken at their Burbank location. Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria said that participating locations generally require 48 hours notice to prepare for the challenge. As the meme states, a challenge group consisting of eight (not nine) people has two hours to eat the entire pizza (which consists of approximately 200 slices, measures 54\" by 54\", and weighs about 50 lbs). The pizza must have at least one topping and costs about $235, a price that is refunded should the participants successfully consume the entire pizza. The chain added that while three to four teams generally attempt the pizza challenge each month, so far only two contestant teams have managed to successfully complete the challenge and earn the $1,000 prize.

In that iteration, the photo wasn't rumored to have been taken in Florida. A roughly translated excerpt placed the implausible catch in Spain:", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The image shows a man proudly posing with giant prawn or shrimp, at least fifteen kilos of weight. The commentary accompanying the photo Ascent Sunday the Facebook group \"Asturias our land\" (with almost 2,700 members) - is as follows: \"Shrimp fish yesterday in the Asturian coast ... We big .. .! Pa a \"tapina '. Puxa!.\" Within hours the \"news\" circulated like wildfire and generated discussion threads among those who appreciated the humorous nature of the case and those who believed it. Once again, a hoax on the network (\"hoax\" in English) came to be taken as credible as if it were a proven information with rigor and professionalism. Google had yet another locale for the well-traveled fish, as a reverse image search automatically suggested Queensland as photo's location (discussed in an August 2015 forum thread). A separate search by image showed that the photograph was originally uploaded in 2010; it could have been taken (or altered) far earlier. The 2010 result led to a dead link, but was hosted on a web site for a fishing club in the Florida Keys (presumably, a catch of that nature would warrant a mention by avid sport fishermen). On 4 September 2014, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission published a status update to Facebook reporting the capture of a large, shrimp-like creature measuring 18 inches long: Who you calling a shrimp ?Steve Bargeron was fishing from a dock in Fort Pierce as he watched a fellow fisherman pull... Posted by MyFWC on Thursday, September 4, 2014 Who you calling a shrimp ?Steve Bargeron was fishing from a dock in Fort Pierce as he watched a fellow fisherman pull... Posted by MyFWC on Thursday, September 4, 2014 Those photographs didn't match the circulating \"102 lb. shrimp\" image, and the crustacean depicted wasn't technically a shrimp. The documented catch occurred in the Indian River near Fort Pierce, Florida and a weight wasn't provided. Professor of integrative biology Roy Caldwell told LiveScience that the 2014 find was unlikely to have occurred as described, and that photography was an unreliable barometer of mantis shrimp size: The specimen caught in Florida belongs to a species of Lysiosquilla, according to Caldwell. Like other members of its species, the creature has three pairs of walking legs and a large, articulated abdomen, Caldwell noted. \"This particular group Lysiosquillidae are almost all banded yellow and black across their bodies,\" Caldwell said. They can live for 30 years and can grow to be 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) long, he added ... this specimen doesn't belong to the largest of stomatopod species, according to the biologist. That distinction goes to Lysiosquillina maculata, which inhabit the Pacific Ocean from Hawaii to east Africa. Caldwell said the largest known members of the species were 15 inches (38 cm) long. Caldwell, who said he's been studying stomatopods for 50 years, said an 18-inch catch is unlikely. Photos, he pointed out, can sometimes be deceiving. He also noted that, with its claws extended, a stomatopod tends to look much longer than it really is. The standard for measuring the creatures is from the tip of the eye to the end of the tail claws not included. Marine biologists doubted that the purported 18-inch long mantis shrimp was as big as estimates claimed in 2014, and it was thrown back almost immediately (preventing further examination). Moreover, the documented newsworthy crustacean catch occurred in September 2014, whereas the viral photo of indeterminate origin existed as early as March 2010.

The claim cleverly layered the suggestion of a falsehood within its own fabrication to facilitate the spread of the story; by that sleight of hand, readers surmised the girl had lied about her sexual experience and had blamed the flu vaccine to deflect suspicion about the true nature of her pregnancy. None of this (neither the girl's claims nor the article reporting them) was true, however. World News Daily Report is just one of many fake news sites that print fictitious articles, as noted in their disclaimer: WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website even those based on real people are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle. World News Daily Report previously spread fake news stories about loggers accidentally cutting down the world's largest tree, Yoko Ono's admitting to an affair with Hillary Clinton, and a 179-year-old man living in India.

Charles Bolden, who was appointed to head of NASA by President Obama, issued a 1000 page document explaining the event to the White House.

Newswatch33 is a fake news site began darkening the doorstep of social media networks shortly after the nearly identical NewsWatch28 fake news site shut down in mid-2015. Moreover, the \"15 days of darkness\" yarn was lifted from an older (debunked) viral rumor that has been around the online block several times before. Newswatch33 has hoaxed social media users a number of times since its inception, falsely claiming that supporters raised $4 million for the defense of Charleston shooting suspect Dylann Roof, that a girl was electrocuted by her iPhone's earbuds, that Jay-Z and Beyonce purchased the rights to the Confederate flag, and that the federal government had impregnated inexpensive cigars with listening devices. In October 2015, the fake news web site Huzlers published an article titled \"NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2015!\"; that article essentially repackaged the original fabrication. Previous Huzlers hoaxes included a claim that semen was found in Starbucks drinks nationwide, that McDonald's was busted using \"human meat,\" that Chipotle was caught using cat and dog meat in their meals, and that an Ebola victim rose from the dead as a zombie.

The format is easily recognizable as one wherein words are attributed to the individual pictured, and in this case image claims that Donald Trump made the following statement in a 1998 interview with People magazine: If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.", "Fact Check": "Did Donald Trump say in 1998 that he would one day run as a Republican because they are the \"dumbest group of voters\"?", "Description": "Despite People's comprehensive online content archive, we found no interview or profile on Donald Trump in 1998 (or any other time) that quoted his saying anything that even vaguely resembled the words in this meme. Trump appeared somewhat regularly in the magazine's pages before he came to star on The Apprentice, but the bulk of the magazine's celebrity-driven coverage of him back then centered on his marriages to, and divorces from, Ivana Trump and Marla Maples. Trump's political endeavors (or the absence of them) did rate some space on the magazine's pages, though. For example, a December 1987 profile titled \"Too Darn Rich\" chronicled Trump's later claims that he had been courted by both Democrats and Republicans: House Speaker Jim Wright led a delegation to Trump's office asking him to chair a major fund-raising event for the Democratic Party. Trump is a Republican but gave the invitation serious consideration before bowing to pressure from GOP friends and turning down his Democratic suitors. Beryl Anthony Jr., the Arkansas Congressman who came up with the approach to Trump, was disappointed. \"There's no question he was getting a lot of pressure from the Republicans,\" Anthony told a reporter. \"It would have given him the opportunity to see if his temperament is sufficient, if he could stand the scrutiny.\" In 1988, Trump launched into an impassioned political diatribe on Oprah Winfrey's daytime talk show, but he concluded by saying he \"probably\" wouldn't [ever] run for office. In 1998 (the year the quote in question purportedly appeared in People), Trump's political involvement was somewhat differently oriented: \"My information is that Donald Trump has raised in the ballpark of $1 million for the Bush campaign and the Republican Party,\" said Sen. Steven Geller, president of the National Council of Legislators from Gaming States. \"I have heard from too many sources, including Republican lobbyists, that although Mr. Bush is denying it, the deal [to allow Indian casinos in Florida) has been cut,\" Geller said. By October 1999, Trump had become more serious about dipping his toes in political waters. Announcing on CNN's Larry King Live that he was forming an exploratory committee with the intention of running for president, Trump said: I'm a registered Republican. I'm a pretty conservative guy. I'm somewhat liberal on social issues, especially health care, et cetera, but I'd be leaving another party, and I've been close to that party ... I think that nobody is really hitting it right. The Democrats are too far left. I mean, Bill Bradley, this is seriously left; he's trying to come a little more center, but he's seriously left. The Republicans are too far right. And I don't think anybody's hitting the chord, not the chord that I want hear, and not the chord that other people want to hear, and I've seen it. At around the same time in October 1998, Trump ran through his then-current political positions with NBC's Stone Phillips: Mr. TRUMP: I'd like to see major tax cuts. PHILLIPS: Along the line, for what the Republicans are talking about eight hundred billion or so? Would you go that far? Mr. TRUMP: Along the lines of that number, yes, approximately at that number, and could even be more. PHILLIPS: Health care? Mr. TRUMP: [I'm] liberal on health care, we have to take care of people that are sick. PHILLIPS: Universal health coverage? Mr. TRUMP: I like universal, we have to take care, there's nothing else. What's the country all about if we're not going to take care of our sick? PHILLIPS: Abortion? Mr. TRUMP: I hate the concept of abortion. I hate anything about abortion, and yet, I'm totally for choice. I think you have no alternative. PHILLIPS: Gun control? Where do you stand on that? Mr. TRUMP: If you could tell me that the bad guys, the criminals, wouldn't have guns, I'd be a hundred percent for gun control. But the fact is, if you have gun control, the only people that are going to obey the laws, are going to be the good guys. So the bad guys are going to have the guns, the good guys aren't going to have the guns, and what good does that do us? So, I'm not in favor of it. Notable about the image's apparently spurious Trump quote is its purported reference to Fox News in 1998. While the Fox News Channel was rolled out across major American news markets between 1996 and 2000 (and thus isn't entirely chronologically out of place in a circa-1998 quote), the network wasn't nearly as prominent or widely watched until the 2000 election of George W. Bush, the September 11th attacks in 2001, and the start of the Iraq War in 2002. Before that time, although Fox News was making its way into living rooms across the United States, it was not exceptionally well-known (or particularly regarded as a right-leaning outlet) in 1998.

Yorkers posted a photo purportedly showing a 41 lb rat that was caught in New York City:", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "41 pound rat recently caught in NYC... (via Chris Brannigan) While the above-displayed image has been shared by various outlets, no one has been able to provide any substantial information about the enormous rodent. If this rat truly was \"caught\" in New York City, it is most likely a brown rat, or Norway rat. The city has approximately two million brown rats, according to a 2014 study, but these animals can only grow to about 20 inches in length and 2 lbs in weight. But as many commenters pointed out on The New Yorker's post, the animal doesn't look like it was caught at all. The rat looks groomed and cleaned and was most likely someone's pet. If that's the case, the above-pictured animal is probably a Gambian Pouch Rat. While these animals are larger than the brown rat, they don't typically get any bigger than four pounds. So why does the rat pictured above appear so massive? It's likely the result of forced perspective. The person is holding the rat (you'll notice that their hands cannot be seen in the photo) is probably using a pole to place the animal closer to the camera. While this makes the rat appear larger in the photo, the animal pictured is just an average sized rat. For comparison's sake, here's a photo of a 3 foot Gambian Pouch Rat that was caught in New York in 2012: In summation, the above-displayed photo does not show a 41 lb rat that was caught in New York City. While we can't determine the exact dimensions of the above-pictured animal, it was likely someone's pet and weighed no more than four pounds.

that the Halloween celebrated on 31 October 2015 would be the 666th such event in history. If we assume that Halloween celebrations are held annually, this rumor suggests that the first Halloween took place in 1350. But Halloween does not have any definitive beginning (the holiday evolved over a long period of time and was influenced by several different cultures), and there is no basis for the notion that the first Halloween was held in 1350:", "Fact Check": "Will the Halloween celebrated on 31 October 2015 be the 666th in history?", "Description": "It is widely believed that many Hallowe'en traditions have evolved from an ancient Celtic festival called Samhain which was Christianised by the early Church. Pronounced sow-in, Samhain is a Gaelic word meaning 'end of the summer'. This festival is believed to have been a celebration of the end of the harvest, and a time of preparation for the coming winter. It is widely accepted that the early church missionaries chose to hold a festival at this time of year in order to absorb existing native Pagan practices into Christianity, thereby smoothing the conversion process. A letter Pope Gregory I sent to Bishop Mellitus in the 6th century, in which he suggested that existing places of non-Christian worship be adopted and consecrated to serve a Christian purpose, is often provided as supporting evidence of this method of acculturation. Encyclopaedia Britannica states that this date may have been chosen \"in an effort to supplant the Pagan holiday with a Christian observance\". The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions also claims that Hallowe'en \"absorbed and adopted the Celtic new year festival, the eve and day of Samhain\". However, there are supporters of the view that Hallowe'en, as the eve of All Saints' Day, originated entirely independently of Samhain and some question the existence of a specific pan-Celtic religious festival which took place on 31st October/1st November. While Nicholas Rogers argued in his book Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night that \"festivals commemorating the saints as opposed to the original Christian martyrs appear to have been observed by 800,\" it is unclear when these festivals became what we know now as Halloween. According to various dictionaries, the word \"Halloween\" itself originated in the mid-18th century, a shortening of a term that dates to the mid-16th century: c.1745, Scottish shortening of Allhallow-even \"Eve of All Saints, last night of October\" (1550s), the last night of the year in the old Celtic calendar, where it was Old Year's Night, a night for witches. A pagan holiday given a cursory baptism and sent on its way. In the United States, Halloween was initially known as an occasion for playing pranks; the modern form of Halloween celebration didn't gain widespread popularity there until the early 20th century. Anoka, Minnesota, is often credited with holding the first official Halloween celebration in the United States, which took place in 1920: Anoka, Minnesota is believed to be the first city in the United States to put on a Halloween celebration to divert its youngsters from Halloween pranks. When Anokans awoke to find their cows roaming Main Street, their windows soaped and their outhouses tipped over, they decided something had to be done. In 1920, George Green and other Anoka civic leaders suggested the idea of a giant celebration. The idea was adopted by the Anoka Commercial Club and the Anoka Kiwanis Club; both giving their full support. In September of that year, a Halloween committee was organized. It's impossible to pinpoint an exact year for the first Halloween, and the rumor about 2015's seeing the \"666th Halloween\" seems to be an offshoot of earlier joke memes claiming that in the current year Halloween will fall on Friday the 13th for the first time in 666 years.

The idea that dangerous social media challenges are popular seems to be on the upswing. The ice bucket challenge of mid-2014 may well have inspired the increase in social media challenge fads; but parental fears of largely non-existent practices such as \"rainbow parties,\" vodka-infused tampons, bedbug smoking, and 'beezin preceded it.", "Fact Check": "Are teenagers daring one another to participate in the 72-hour challenge \"Game of 72,\" then disappearing for several days?", "Description": "In 2015, anxious parents feared that the paracetamol challenge would inspire their children to overdose on over-the-counter painkillers; and in the same vein, the 72-hour challenge (also known as the \"Game of 72\") prompted concerns that kids were participating in a pointless and dangerous social media fad. In April 2015, the Daily Mail published a thinly-sourced article titled \"Parents left terrified by cruel new 'game' on Facebook that sees children dare each other to vanish for 72 hours without telling relatives.\" As with other panics of similar nature, the article breathlessly described a \"game\" that sounded of no real interest to teens whatsoever and included scant evidence that participants were actually undertaking the purported challenge: An alleged Facebook game which sees children dare each other to vanish without a trace for up to three days is spreading panic among parents in France. The dare, dubbed the 'Game of 72', involves teenagers challenging each other to disappear without a word to their families for 12, 24 or 72 hours. Authorities have been alerted to the game after a 13-year-old girl from northern France went missing for three days. So far, police say, the only evidence is dozens of panicked Facebook posts being shared by parents, warning each other about the game, and Emma's testimony, to suggest the challenge exists. That article referenced France's The Local, whose original article (also published on 29 April 2015) was far plainer in describing what was in all likelihood a classic urban legend of the crime-warning variety. The article admitted that the \"Game of 72 could even be more of a hoax than an actual phenomenon\" but went on to say that the \"fact that officials are taking the incident seriously is perhaps unsurprising given France's troubling history when it comes to dangerous social media crazes\": News of the latest challenge came after a 13-year-old girl from northern France who went missing for three days finally turned up safe and well at her home at the weekend. The girl, named Emma in the French press, reportedly refused to tell police or her parents where she had been or whom she had been with, but simply said she had taken on a dare through Facebook called '12, 24, 72' or 'Game of 72', as it is also known. The Facebook challenge, meanwhile, has left authorities baffled not least because they've been unable to actually find examples of it online. Rather, they've uncovered plenty of panicked postings from parents who are eager to warn each other about the game. This one below says \"Attention Danger!\" and warns of \"another stupid game doing the rounds on the net\". It tells parents to explain to their children that its better to fail the dare rather have \"something tragic happen to them.\" The fact that a 13-year-old girl in France named Emma disappeared for three days at some point in April 2015 has been proffered as the sole piece of evidence documenting that the \"Game of 72\" is a real phenomenon. But there's just one problem that story about Emma doesn't check out: Francois Perain, the prosecutor in Valenciennes, the district where the incident took place, [said] that the game \"seems to be an excuse\". \"Actually we think that Emma joined up with someone when she ran away, and that was the main reason for her running away,\" he said. \"Everything points to the fact that the game (which may be imaginary) is the explanation that Emma gave as the reason why she ran away, and to protect the person she met. That person is currently being looked for by the police,\" he said. Aside from that discredited story, the only evidence such a \"challenge\" had occurred consisted of ping-ponging warnings among French parents on social media sites issued after the fact. Moreover, no one was even sure if the kids participating were hiding for 12, 24, or 72 hours. It took about a week for the Game of 72 to make its way to North America, but by that point a \"small number\" of \"temporary disappearances in Europe\" had stolen French Emma's thunder: Halton police are warning parents to talk to their children about a dangerous new game allegedly making the rounds on social media known as the Game of 72. It encourages young people to disappear and stay hidden for 72 hours without contacting friends or family, said police. The Game of 72 is being blamed for a small number of temporary disappearances in Europe, but so far, no missing person cases have been attributed to it in Canada or the U.S., according to media reports. Even so, the game had Vancouver police worried enough to issue a warning about it earlier this week. (\"Possibly one, maybe not\" is indeed a very small number, and it should be noted that a social media challenge is a far better excuse to one's parents than \"I snuck out and was scared to come home\" or \"I ran away and changed my mind.\") At around the same time, scattered police departments began to warn parents about the terrifying new craze: On 7 May 2015, Mic published an article that cast doubt on whether the 72-hour challenge was a genuine teen fad or media invention. And much like the February 2015 rumor of measles parties, it seemed news outlets reached to find \"evidence\" of police concern about the purported trend: \"We never issued a warning about the game as has been reported,\" Constable Brian Montague, a spokesman for the Vancouver Police Department (VPD), said. \"We responded to questions about it from media and unfortunately they turned it into a warning from police.\" The VPD was featured in a recent news story about the fad, which included an interview with an online awareness expert. \"The game's popularity shows that parents need to stay up to the minute on their kids' computer habits,\" the story reads. On the contrary, Montague told Mic, the department hasn't come across any instances of the game in Vancouver. \"I am not even aware of any confirmed examples in Canada,\" he said. A lack of any confirmed incidents whatsoever and a corresponding absence of any social media chatter (aside from people wondering why kids would undertake the 72-hour challenge) didn't discourage news outlets from advancing the rumor once again in June 2015: https://twitter.com/EyesOfARedWolf/status/611126365379784704 In a thread published by Kathy Sweeney of Southeastern Missouri television station KFVS, numerous users speculated that multiple reported disappearances were linked to the game. Sweeney claimed a \"Facebook page\" was \"encouraging\" kids to participate (but appeared to be unable to produce a link to it) and reiterated the unsupported assertion that the \"game\" had first appeared in Europe: There's even a Facebook page dedicated to it please share to warn other parents! ... Not sure but it apparently already made the rounds in Europe. As BBC Trending blogger Mike Wendling observed about the \"Game of 72\": For a \"game\" that is supposedly catching on all over the world, there's scant chatter about it on social media. Only a few hundred tweets have been sent about the \"game\" most referencing news articles. Facebook searches in English and French throw up relatively few hits and again, most link to media reports. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which runs the UK's best-known helpline for children, told Trending that they haven't received any calls about the \"game\". Some of the coverage of the \"game\" compared it to other trends such as neknomination the viral challenge where people were egging friends on to complete a dangerous and/or drinking-related stunt. But whereas neknomination was a real thing as were other potentially dangerous games such as the \"cinnamon challenge\" the \"game of 72\" appears to be nothing more than a lost-in-translation rumour.

I don t have the right to any other view. My only emotion is gratitude, literally, for my life.\"", "Fact Check": "Did Jack Nicholson say that he was \"positively against\" abortion?", "Description": "This short statement is full of humility, wisdom, and courage. Note that he says, I don t have the right to any other view. He has understood, thanks to the knowledge that his own life almost never happened, that life is a gift for which we should all feel gratitude. His willingness to vocally oppose abortion in the face of Hollywood and his own political party is inspiring and should be encouraged. While these articles were presented as current news stories, that is not the case. Nicholson's statement comes from a 1984 interview with Rolling Stone magazine in which the actor talked about his complicated family life. During the interview, Nicholson said that he was \"positively against\" abortion since his mother June nearly decided to end her pregnancy: I'm very contra my constituency in terms of abortion because I'm positively against it. I don't have the right to any other view. My only emotion is gratitude, literally, for my life. If June and Ethel had been of less character, I would never have gotten to live. These women gave me the gift of life. It's a feminist narrative in the very pure form. Despite Nicholson's comments to Rolling Stone in 1984, the actor told the Washington Post in 1990 that while he was personally against abortion he still considered himself to be politically pro-choice: \"I'm pro-choice but against abortion because I'm an illegitimate child myself and it would be hypocritical to take any other position. I'd be dead. I wouldn't exist,\" the star and director of \"The Two Jakes\" said in a Washington Post interview. \"And I have nothing but total admiration, gratitude and respect for the strength of the women who made the decision they made in my individual case. But as I say, I believe this is the choice of the woman and, you know, I walk it like I talk it.\" Nicholson was 38 when he learned that his \"mother\" was really his grandmother and that the woman he had known as his sister was in fact his mother. While Jack Nicholson did say that he was \"positively against\" abortion, his comment was made decades ago and doesn't fully address the actor's more nuanced views on the subject.

Customers reported hearing loud squealing coming from the bathroom in the back area of the store near the layaway department. An eyewitness said her seven-year-old son went in to use the restroom, and came out screaming, Mommy, mommy is a man in the bathroom holding a pig really close to him!", "Fact Check": "Was an Alabama man caught having sex with a pig in a Walmart bathroom?", "Description": "Confused, the woman alerted a store clerk and was informed they already had several complaints about noise in the restroom. Raymond Cooper, an employee at the Walmart store, said he was the one that ran in and saved the pig. When I went into the bathroom, I heard squealing from inside the stall. I told the man to open it but he wouldn t, so I kicked it in. That crazy ass fool for real was doing a pig. I socked him in the face and grabbed the pig. That fool was out cold. However, Now8News (styled to mimic a local television station news site, like KLAS) is a newcomer to the burgeoning fake news genre, one that further aims to confuse readers by blending wildly sensational claims like the one above with re-writes of actual news events. The pig sex tale is (of course) false, and the mugshot was one of sovereign citizen and former fugitive Edward Eugene Harper. On 17 July 2015, Now8News published cannibalized a fabricated claim (involving a man on a park bench being eaten by pigeons) which first appeared on the similar fake news site NewsWatch28. On the same date, Now8News published a different, entirely made-up story claiming McDonald's was caught using aborted fetuses in Chicken McNuggets.

"Example": "[Collected via e-mail, January 2016] Hey guys! Can you please check out this \"800 year old cell phone found\" story that's floating around the internet? Origin:On 23 December 2015, the conspiracy theory web site Mysterious Universe published a photo purportedly showing an ancient clay tablet resembling a cellphone which was dug up by archaeologists \"earlier this year\" in Austria: While Mysterious Universe failed to provide the details you'd expect from a possibly world-changing dig, such as the names of the archaeologists, secondary photos of the tablet, comments from the team, the object's dimensions, et cetera, the web site did manage to add some wild speculation about the object: A controversial theory proposed by author Zecharia Sitchin is that aliens known as the Anunnaki came from Nibiru (the rumored Planet X beyond Neptune) and created the Sumerian civilization. The tablet looks surprisingly like a modern phone, with the 12 keys, a display and a talk button. Could these extraterrestrials have tried to introduce the Sumerians to a phone-like communications device, only to find they weren t ready for it and dialed them back to a stylus and clay tablets? While the theory that the above-displayed cellphone was created by the alien race Anunnaki from the planet Nibiru in order to introduce the Sumerian civilization to modern technology is interesting, this \"alien cellphone\" was actually created by a German sculptor and is only a few years old. Karin and Karl Weing rtner of the Art Replik Studio created the clay tablet in January 2012. While the photo was originally shared with a description similar to the one published by Mysterious Universe (Art Replik never mentioned aliens) there are several indications that this post was simply a joke, such as the title of the object, \"BablyoNokia,\" comments on the photo (\"Yes, exactly!\" in response to \"is that my old phone\"), and the fact that the image was watermarked art-replik.com. The \"alien phone\" was created in jest and was likely used as a marketing tool: The above-displayed \"ancient cellphone\" was not discovered by a group of archaeologists in Austria and it was not left behind by aliens. It was created by a German sculptor who specializes in making replicas of ancient art.

William Shakespeare's plays began circulating online. Although the authorship of Shakespeare's plays remains a topic of some debate among scholars, the above-displayed meme contains several factual errors. First, Aemilia Bassano (later Emilia Lanier) was indeed a published author, not someone whose work was suppressed because of her race or gender. In fact, the Shakespearean Authorship Trust notes that Bassano became the \"first woman to publish a book of original poetry\" when her work Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum was put into print in 1611:", "Fact Check": "Is a black woman named Amelia Bassano the true author of all of William Shakespeare's plays?", "Description": "Brought up opposite the theatre district in a family of Venetian Jews of Moroccan ancestry, at the age of 7 she was given to be educated by Countess Susan Bertie, in the family headed by Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby. At the age of 13 she became mistress to Lord Hunsdon, the man in charge of the English theatre. When she got pregnant a decade later she was expelled from court and married off to a minstrel. She was one of the first women to own and operate a school and the first woman to publish a book of original poetry Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum (1611). She died in poverty. Second, Bassano was not black. She was born to Baptista Bassano (a Venice musician at the court of Elizabeth I) and Margaret Johnson in 1569, and biographies of her note that: (Amelia Bassano) was part of a family of Italian court musicians of Moroccan/Semitic ancestry who lived as clandestine Jews. No contemporaneous accounts describe Bassano as \"black\" (or \"African\"), and although its provenance is uncertain, many historians believe that this miniature portrait by Nicholas Hilliard depicts Amelia Bassano: Amelia Bassano have been dark-complected, however. A 2009 paper published in the Oxfordian, the journal of Shakespearean authorship studies, stated that some of Bassano's relatives were referred to as \"black\" when they arrived in London, likely due to their dark complexions: Brought to London from Venice in 1538/9, the dark-skinned Bassanos, some of whom were described in contemporary records as 'black' and who may have been of Moroccan as well as Jewish ancestry, became established as the Court recorder troupe.\" Lastly, the claim that Amelia Bassano wrote all of William Shakespeare's plays is a decidedly fringe notion, even within the world of Shakespearean authorship controversies. While she is listed as a potential candidate by the Shakespearean Authorship Trust (a group seemingly determined to credit Shakespeare's work to anyone but Shakespeare himself), even among that group she is included as just one of 66 candidates identified so far: She has long been identified as the 'dark lady' of the Sonnets. Her candidacy was announced in March 2007 in a lecture at the Smithsonian Institution as part of the Washington Shakespeare Festival by John Hudson, artistic director of the Dark Lady Players, a New York company who perform the underlying Jewish allegories in the plays.

(Almost immediately, that decision led to a number of rumors and viral claims; that pedophiles would soon be granted similar rights, that Joe Biden had gone on a victory spree, and that Facebook had begun tracking the political beliefs of users via a celebratory rainbow filter for profile pictures.) Tangential rumors circulated pertaining to individuals and businesses who subsequently (or previously) went out on a limb for their religious opposition to marriage equality, which included a false claim involving a pastor purportedly jailed for refusing to marry a gay couple and the true case of an Oregon bakery ordered to pay damages stemming from a pre-decision refusal to serve a same-sex couple. The meme displayed above was inspired by Kentucky court clerk named Kim Davis, who unwittingly starred in a viral video during which she refused to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple shortly after the June 2015 Supreme Court ruling.", "Fact Check": "Did Kentucky hire an Amish DMV clerk who refused to issue driver's licenses based on her religious beliefs?", "Description": "On 12 August 2015, U.S. District Judge David L. Bunning ordered Davis [PDF] to begin issuing licenses as requested. Bunning wrote in his ruling that by \"openly adopting a policy that promotes her own religious convictions at the expenses of others,\" Davis had violated the law, adding: Davis remains free to practice her Apostolic Christian beliefs. She may continue to attend church twice a week, participate in Bible Study and minister to female inmates at the Rowan County Jail. She is even free to believe that marriage is a union between one man and one woman, as many Americans do. However, her religious convictions cannot excuse her from performing the duties that she took an oath to perform as Rowan County Clerk. The humorous image above was clearly created to poke fun at Davis over the legal dispute (and the general issue of allowing personal religious beliefs to trump the requirements of employment and public service), a subtlety lost on many social media users who hadn't heard of the marriage license controversy in Kentucky and consequently didn't get the joke. The jape partially relies outsider assumptions about Amish culture, one of which is the notion that Amish people are prohibited from driving due to their religion. That's not precisely accurate, as use of a horse-and-buggy over cars is primarily a cultural choice and not part of a specific anti-automobile religious edict applied to everyone: Although the Amish are allowed to use automobiles for social and business functions, the church rules prohibit members from owning as well as driving a car. Amish businessmen are also not allowed to provide loans to non-Amish employees for the purpose of buying a vehicle. Ownership of an automobile is considered a taboo. It is important to the community to maintain the horse and buggy as a symbol of Amish identity. The joke also leans on a (fallacious) assumption that Amish citizens neither seek nor require state driver's licenses, part of a broad, inaccurate perception of the community as frightened of the outside world. The Amish often need state-issued ID for a variety of day-to-day purposes, including the operation of lucrative businesses (contrary to the belief Amish people reject wealth and/or financial success entirely or that they lack awareness of modern conventions). Photographic requirements have presented problems for Amish people seeking licenses, however, as their traditions generally favor the avoidance of photography. (Yet another misconception asserts the practice is due to a primitive, uneducated fear that the camera might \"steal\" a person's soul; in actuality, it's more due to intentional humility and not a fear of technology.) While the meme seen here satirizes the imposition of religious belief on outsiders by a presumably stricter sect, it should be noted that Amish communities are known for a marked disinclination to interact with the \"English\" world save for necessary circumstances. Although their religious beliefs are notoriously stringent, Amish folks are far likelier to be encroached upon by a conflict of law and faith than the other way around.

government building at Oregon's Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, posted a message comparing his actions to those of civil rights leader Rosa Parks: While the above-displayed message was posted by the Twitter account @Ammon_Bundy, it doesn't appear that the rancher has anything to do with the account. First, this is a brand new Twitter account which was started on 3 January 2016. While it is possible that Bundy would start a new Twitter account to take advantage of the media attention, the rancher has had a Facebook account for more than a year and frequently uses the social network to provide updates from Oregon. Second, the @Ammon_Bundy Twitter account uses a screenshot from one of Bundy's videos as its profile pic. If the account were real, it's likely that Bundy would have used an actual photo. Finally, MSNBC reporter Tony Dokoupil, who has been reporting from the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge since shortly after Bundy's men took over the building, confirmed that the account was fake: While it's possible that someone associated with the Bundy is operating the @Ammon_Bundy Twitter account, it's more likely that the account is being operated by a remote sympathizer.

While the exact origins of the above-displayed image are unknown, it is a composite of two separate photos. The photo of Amy Winehouse was taken in 2011 in London: Amy Winehouse heads to the Hawley Arms pub in Camden, north London, wearing a pink Pringle sweater. Amy had earlier attended a recording session at the famous Abbey Road studios with Taylor Swift. The photograph of Lana Del Rey was taken in 2012 before a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert: This photo of Lana Del Rey was flipped in order to make the composite image of Rey and Winehouse. One way to tell that the image has been flipped is by looking at the lettering on Del Rey's AC/DC shirt, which is backwards on the composite image. This isn't the first time that a composite image of two celebrities has circulated as the real thing. Shortly after the deaths of Lemmy and David Bowie, a fake photograph purportedly showing the two together at a party went viral.

That Facebook post, which also included a response from Special Olympics athlete John Franklin Stephens, quickly went viral and racked up more than a half million shares in 24 hours:", "Fact Check": "Did Ann Coulter refer to President Obama as a \"retard,\" prompting a response from a Special Olympics athlete?", "Description": "Some people who viewed the Facebook post questioned its authenticity, as they couldn't find the \"Obama retard\" tweet in Coulter's Twitter feed. The reason for that was because the referenced comment was one she made after a 2012 presidential debate between President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney, not something Coulter said in 2015 as implied by the Facebook post: Shortly after the tweet made headlines in 2012, Ann Coulter appeared on Alan Colmes' Fox News radio show to double down on her trolling: \"Look, no one would refer to a Down Syndrome child, someone with an actual mental handicap, by saying 'retard.' Where do you think the words 'imbecile,' 'idiot,' 'moron,' 'cretin' come from? These were all technical terms at one time. 'Retard' had been used colloquially to just mean 'loser' for 30 years ... But no, no these aggressive victims have to come out and tell you what words to use.\" The response from Special Olympics athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens is also real, although also not recent. On 23 October 2012, Stephens posted it as open letter to Coulter on the Special Olympics Blog: Dear Ann Coulter, Come on Ms. Coulter, you aren t dumb and you aren t shallow. So why are you continually using a word like the R-word as an insult? I m a 30 year old man with Down syndrome who has struggled with the public s perception that an intellectual disability means that I am dumb and shallow. I am not either of those things, but I do process information more slowly than the rest of you. In fact it has taken me all day to figure out how to respond to your use of the R-word last night. I thought first of asking whether you meant to describe the President as someone who was bullied as a child by people like you, but rose above it to find a way to succeed in life as many of my fellow Special Olympians have. Then I wondered if you meant to describe him as someone who has to struggle to be thoughtful about everything he says, as everyone else races from one snarkey sound bite to the next. Finally, I wondered if you meant to degrade him as someone who is likely to receive bad health care, live in low grade housing with very little income and still manages to see life as a wonderful gift. Because, Ms. Coulter, that is who we are and much, much more. After I saw your tweet, I realized you just wanted to belittle the President by linking him to people like me. You assumed that people would understand and accept that being linked to someone like me is an insult and you assumed you could get away with it and still appear on TV. I have to wonder if you considered other hateful words but recoiled from the backlash. Well, Ms. Coulter, you, and society, need to learn that being compared to people like me should be considered a badge of honor. No one overcomes more than we do and still loves life so much. Come join us someday at Special Olympics. See if you can walk away with your heart unchanged.

during that time, a circulating rumor claimed Anne Frank was denied entry to the United States before her death in the Holocaust. While most Americans were familiar with Anne Frank (and many read her diary in school), the claim labeling her a prospective refugee seemed novel. Its appearance during an ongoing debate about Syrian refugees similarly prompted some skepticism among those who hadn't before heard the it, as Frank's ordeal and death comprised a story with which many were familiar.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "On 14 February 2007 The New York Times published an article titled \"Letters reveal desperate plight of Anne Frank's family,\" reporting that documents newly uncovered by an accident of circumstance revealed the Frank family's failed attempts at entry to the U.S.: After lying undisturbed in a New Jersey warehouse for nearly 30 years, documents revealing the desperate efforts of Anne Frank's family to escape to the United States and Cuba from Nazi-occupied Holland in 1941 have been discovered thanks to a clerical error. \"I am forced to look out for emigration and as far as I can see U.S.A. is the only country we could go to,\" Anne's father, Otto, wrote to his college friend, Nathan Straus Jr., the head of the federal Housing Authority, a friend of Eleanor Roosevelt's and the son of a Macy's co-owner, asking him to put up a $5,000 bond. \"It is for the sake of the children mainly that we have to care for. Our own fate is of less importance,\" Otto Frank wrote. Page by page, the papers illustrate the tortuous process for gaining entry to the United States in those days. Even with powerful connections and money, European Jews could not overcome the State Department's restrictions against refugees, said two Holocaust scholars who examined the documents. As the war in Europe intensified, so too did Otto Frank's efforts to transport his family to safety. He ultimately settled on an attempt to enter through Cuba, a plan which never reached fruition: By June 1941, no one with close relatives still in Germany was allowed into the United States because of suspicions that the Nazis could use them to blackmail refugees into clandestine cooperation. That development ended the possibility of getting the Frank girls out through a children's rescue agency. Because of the uncertainty, Otto Frank decided to try for a single visa for himself. It was granted and forwarded to him on Dec. 1. No one knows if it arrived. Ten days later, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States and Havana canceled the visa. Reuters covered the discovery on 14 February 2007, including commentary from Holocaust scholars who lamented the family's failed attempt at passage: If her father had sought help sooner, \"Anne Frank could be a 77-year-old woman living in Boston today, a writer. That is what the YIVO's documents suggest,\" said Richard Breitman, a professor at American University. However, Otto Frank decided to try to escape just as the Nazis were making it more difficult to leave and the United States was making it more difficult to enter, Breitman said. Cuba issued Otto Frank a visa on December 1, 1941, according to the documents, but it was canceled 10 days later when Germany declared war on the United States. A 2007 TIME article provided further details of Otto Frank's increasingly desperate efforts: For nine months, they tried to secure visas first to the U.S. and then to Cuba until that window shut. Just three letters of the file were written by Otto Frank, all addressed to university friend Nathan Straus Jr., son of a co-owner of Macy's department store and head of the U.S. Housing Authority. Straus and Frank's brother-in-law, Julius Hollander, regularly corresponded with two private Jewish agencies, the National Refugee Service in New York and the Boston Committee for Refugees. Straus also contacted the State Department on Frank's behalf. Hollander and his brother arranged affidavits from their employers, Jacob Hiatt of E.F. Dodge Paper Box Co. and Harry Levine of the New England Novelty Co., both of Leominster, Mass. An April 2015 article titled \"Op-Ed: Getting Anne Frank All Wrong\" published to Arutz Sheva addressed the plight of Anne Frank and other Jewish refugee children who perished: Otto Frank, Anne's father, dutifully filled out the small mountain of required application forms and obtained supporting affidavits from the family's relatives in Massachusetts. But that was not enough for those who zealously guarded America's gates against refugees. In fact, in 1941, the Roosevelt administration even added a new restriction: no refugee with close relatives in Europe could come to the U.S., on the grounds that the Nazis might hold their relatives hostage in order to force the refugee to undertake espionage for Hitler. That's right: Anne Frank, Nazi spy. Anne s mother, Edith, wrote to a friend in 1939: \"I believe that all Germany's Jews are looking around the world, but can find nowhere to go.\" On 4 September 2015, Anne Frank's step-sister Eva Schloss drew direct parallels between the Syrian refugee crisis and the Jewish refugee crisis of World War II: You must not be selfish and you must share whatever you have and help in a desperate situation. They need help from you. These people have had the courage to do a very difficult thing- to take your family and your whole life to another country requires bravery and strength. This is history repeating itself. These Syrians are valuable, educated people. These are doctors and nurses who are only too willing to help our society and they will become leaders in the community if you let them. The claim that Anne Frank \"was a refugee\" confused some readers, as they hadn't heard it prior to the Syrian refugee crisis. But the extent to which Otto Frank tried (and failed) to save his family from death during World War II was only first reported in 2007, and thus didn't appear in many history lessons before that. Ultimately Frank perished (likely of Typhus) at Bergen-Belsen in 1945, shortly after the deaths of her mother and sister Margot.

Mayor Kent Guinn, Ocala, Florida Mayor Tom Henry, Fort Wayne Indiana And it is true that a large, established Twitter account linked to Anonymous promised the release of information about prominent

Operation KKK (@Operation_KKK) October 22, 2015 However, the articles cited documents published anonymously to the site Pastebin, to which anyone may upload text-based content.

If you have internet access and the ability to type then you are qualified. Best of all we will pay you if it s good. You talk directly to the editors no form letter rejections. Your work could be seen by millions of people. We are looking for highly unqualified individuals (qualified people are welcome too) familiar with writing, photoshop, infographics, videos, and apps.

In addition to the fact that the the only requirement needed to write for MSMBC.co is the ability to type, the search box for the web site promises users that \"bullcrap\" is only a click away: MSMBC.co is also responsible for a similar death hoax involving country music singer Willie Nelson.

"Example": "[Collected via Twitter, January 2016] Origin:On 10 January 2016, a rumor started circulating on Twitter that former Full House star Ashley Olsen had been murdered in Italy. While most celebrity death hoaxes stem from fake news reports or humorless pranks, the rumor about actress Ashley Olsen's death was rooted in a real, and tragic, news story. The Associated Press reports that another woman named Ashley Olsen, an American artist and fashionista, was found dead in her apartment in Florence: The American artist and fashionista found dead in her apartment in Italy last week was strangled, according to autopsy results announced by Italian investigators Tuesday. The body of 35-year-old Ashley Olsen was discovered in her Florence home on Saturday. She died as a result of murder by strangulation with either a rope or cord-like object, authorities told reporters. Olsen, who is originally from Summer Haven, Florida, was living in the Oltrarno district of Florence and working in the fashion industry. She left the United States for Italy a few years ago to be close to her father, according to Italian news agency ANSA. In addition to sharing the same name, the former Full House star fit the \"American artist\" description and is also approximately the same age (29) as the murder victim. These similarities led many people to mistakenly believe that the Ashley Olsen who was killed in Italy was the same Ashley Olsen who appeared on the TV show Full House. On 12 January 2016, the artist's friends called for Italian authorities to bring her killer to justice: Olsen's friends demanded for her killer to be brought to justice in a letter that appeared in The Florentine, an English-language news magazine. \"Ashley was a rare and kindhearted spirit. She immediately became a familiar part of life in the Oltrarno where she lived, embraced by everyone who knew her,\" they wrote. \"While we mourn her passing we place our trust fully in the Italian authorities to investigate this tragic episode. We wait to hear what they discover, and pray that justice will be swiftly served to whoever is responsible.\" The investigation into Olsen's death is ongoing.

"Example": "[Collected via Email, December 2015] Is this true? Asteroid that Could Cause Disaster Headed Toward Earth on Christmas Eve? Origin:Santa Claus and his reindeer won't be the only objects flying through the sky this Christmas -- an asteroid will be hurtling through the solar system, as well. According to several sensationalized headlines that were published in December 2015, Asteroid 2003 SD220 will come dangerously close to earth on Christmas Eve. \"Asteroid that Could Cause Disaster Headed Toward Earth on Christmas Eve\" The newest asteroid being tracked due to its close proximity to earth is colossal. It s so huge that some claim its gravitational pull could cause earthquakes and make volcanoes erupt. Ironically, it s expected to just barely skim past Earth on Christmas eve. The 1.5 mile wide slab of rock known as 2003 SD220 is so large it could potentially wipe out a continent in the case of a direct hit. While it is true that Asteroid 2003 SD220 will pass by Earth on Christmas Eve, the above-quoted article gets several facts wrong. First, the asteroid will not be getting disconcertingly close to Earth. According to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the closest that the asteroid will get is about 6.8 million miles: \"There is no cause for concern over the upcoming flyby of asteroid 2003 SD220 this Christmas Eve,\" said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for NEO Studies at JPL. \"The closest this object will come to Santa and his eight tiny reindeer is about 28 times the distance between Earth and the moon.\" \"It's going miss Earth by a wide swath, and not be any hazard,\" JPL spokesperson Guy Webster told us. The asteroid also is not \"colossal.\" According to Space.com, the asteroid is relatively small at \"only about 1.24 miles\" wide. Asteroid 2003 SD220's flyby on Christmas Eve is basically a non-event for people outside of the astronomy field, as it is so small and distant that it will not even be visible to the naked eye. This is also not the first time that Asteroid 2003 SD220 has passed by Earth, and it will not be the last. According to NASA, it will make another flyby in 2018: \"The radar images data suggest that asteroid 2003 SD220 is highly elongated and at least 3,600 feet [1,100 meters] in length,\" said Lance Benner of JPL, who leads NASA's asteroid radar research program. \"The data acquired during this pass of the asteroid will help us plan for radar imaging during its upcoming closer approach in 2018.\" Three years from now, the asteroid will safely fly past Earth again, but even closer, at a distance of 1.8 million miles (2.8 million kilometers). The 2018 flyby will be the closest the asteroid will get to Earth until 2070, when it is expected to safely fly past our planet at a distance of about 1.7 million miles (2.7 million kilometers). JPL's Near Earth Object Office, which detects and tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and other space objects, is refuting and clarifying rumors on its verified Twitter account.

a number of social media rumors circulated about Syrian refugees; the above-reproduced photograph (published to Facebook on 14 September 2015) became popular among social media claims. While the photograph included little information about the two images it encompassed, the message of it was clear. At the top, purported Syrian refugees enjoyed luxury accommodations at an unnamed hotel; at the bottom, an American veteran and his dog were left to survive on the streets.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The top image was originally published by the British tabloid Express on 28 September 2014 (more than a year before its November 2015 popularity), along with an article titled \"EXCLUSIVE: Taxpayers fund migrants B&B rooms in top holiday destinations.\" The paper held: The Daily Express has learned that beleaguered Home Office officials have turned to Britannia Hotels, one of the UK s largest groups, to solve the UK s growing asylum epidemic. Coach loads of African and Arab refugees have checked in to the three-star Heathlands and Roundhouse hotels in Britain s premier destination resort while their claims for asylum are processed. The asylum seekers arrived here illegally, the majority via the Port of Calais, which is now home to 2,000 would-be illegal immigrants from a rainbow nation of war-torn countries like Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan. Whether or not those claims were accurate, a few things stood out. One was that the image depicted purported asylum seekers in the United Kingdom. As such, whatever their housing arrangements might have been, it bore little relevance to the plight of homeless American veterans. While an objection could be raised about the strategy of sheltering refugees in hotels overall, it isn't as if those British bed & breakfast rooms could have been used to get American servicemen off the streets of the U.S. The Express claimed asylum seekers enjoyed luxury accommodations, but the hotel the paper named maintained a very low 2.5 star rating on TripAdvisor. Nightly lodging rates for the property started at a miserly $52 a night, and travelers described it as \"cheap,\" \"run-down,\" in need of \"renovations,\" \"shabby,\" \"grubby,\" and \"the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.\" Several were moved to share pictorial representations of the luxury they enjoyed as non-refugee guests of the hotel: Moreover, the original article didn't reference the 2015 flood of refugees from Syria. It identified the asylum seekers in question as primarily from Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan. On 9 October 2014, Bournemouth's Daily Echo published an article titled \"Red Cross worker: the real story of the asylum seekers' \"seaside holiday\" in Bournemouth.\" According to that piece, the original claims were distorted and deliberately misleading: Enjoying a seaside break in luxury, complete with swimming pools and champagne: these are some of the ways the plight of asylum seekers being housed in hotels on the south coast have been described in recent weeks. As a British Red Cross worker, I d like to share with you what I saw. Last week, we arranged for an elderly woman to be taken to A&E because she had not eaten for three days. She was so weak she couldn t even walk. After the group were dropped off at the hotel, it took four days before anyone, including the local authority and the Red Cross, found out ... The hospital raised the alarm when two asylum seekers presented themselves at A&E. And that s when we were called in. We provided basics such as clothes, nappies and female sanitary products, as well as facilitating access to doctors, midwives and health visitors ... At the Red Cross, we support refugees and asylum seekers every day but I ve never seen so many people treated like this before. While it's true that asylum seekers were temporarily housed in a bed & breakfast in Bournemouth in 2014, the meme created the misleading impression that such accommodation was had at the expense of American veterans' care. The image was in fact purportedly taken in Britain in 2014, originally published as part of an anti-refugee missive. A Red Cross worker later stepped forward to clarify that the individuals housed in travel lodging were weak and ill upon their arrival in Britain, not enjoying the amenities of a free vacation. Moreover, whether the images truly depicted asylum seekers or merely involved three non-British vacation-goers remained to be seen. The Express didn't elaborate as to how they determined that the asylum seekers in question were the fellows depicted in the image.

drivers and passengers who are determined not to wear them, for any number of reasons: because they find them too uncomfortable or confining, because they don't believe in their efficacy, because they've heard that wearing seat belts might actually cost them their lives in certain types of accidents, or because they resent as an unwarranted intrusion of government into private life the plethora of laws now requiring motorists to buckle up.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "In this vein, we note with a sense of both sadness and irony a couple of articles recently called to our attention. The first is a 17 September 2004 editorial published in the Daily Nebraskan and entitled \"Individual Rights Buckle Under Seat Belt Laws,\" by Derek Kieper, a 21-year-old senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, in which the writer inveighed against mandatory seat belt laws, opining that \"Uncle Sam is not here to regulate every facet of life no matter the consequences,\" and that \"Democrats and Republicans alike should stand together to stop these laws that are incongruous with the ideals of both parties.\" In the midst of his editorial he noted: As laws become increasingly strict for seat belts, fewer people will respond positively by buckling up in response to the laws. There seems to be a die-hard group of non-wearers out there who simply do not wish to buckle up no matter what the government does. I belong to this group. Evidently his words were far more prescient than any of us might have wanted, as an article in the 4 January 2005 Lincoln Journal Star reported that Mr. Kieper not only died in a car crash, but the tragic mishap that claimed his life was the very type of accident in which seat belts have proved so effective in saving lives by preventing passengers from being ejected from vehicles: Derek Kieper was a smart, funny, intense young man who relished a good debate and would do anything for his friends. Kieper, a 21-year-old senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, died early Tuesday morning when the Ford Explorer he was a passenger in traveled off an icy section of Interstate 80 and rolled several times in a ditch. Kieper, who was riding in the back seat of the Explorer, was ejected from the vehicle. Two others in the vehicle, including the driver, Luke Havermann of Ogallala, and the front-seat passenger, Nick Uphoff of Randolph Air Force Base in Texas, sustained non-life threatening injuries. Havermann and Uphoff, both 21, were being treated at BryanLGH Medical Center West. Derek, who was thrown from the vehicle, was not wearing a seat belt, [Capt. Joe Lefler of the Lancaster County Sheriff's Office] said. He said Havermann and Uphoff were wearing seat belts at the time. In a similar vein, in July 2011 a helmetless motorcyclist participating in a ride to protest mandatory helmet laws was killed when he was thrown over the handlebars of his motorcycle in Onondaga, New York: Philip A. Contos, 55, of Parish, New York, was on a ride organized by the Onondaga chapter of American Bikers Aimed Towards Education (ABATE). Contos hit his brakes, began fishtailing and lost control of his 1983 Harley Davidson. He shot over the handlebars, hit his head on the pavement and was taken to Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse, New York, where he was pronounced dead. State police say evidence at the scene plus information from the attending medical expert indicated Contos would have survived had he been wearing a helmet as required by state law.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2005/01/04/local/doc41db350078259784029686.txt;http://web.archive.org/web/20041105191840/http://www.dailynebraskan.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2004/09/17/414a5a030e91d;", "Example": "", "Last Updated": "4 July 2011", "Credibility": "true", "URL": "www.snopes.com/autos/accident/seatbelt.asp", "Claim": "Anti-seat belt law advocate is killed in automobile accident.", "Claim_ID": "autos_accident_seatbelt", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/autos/accident/seatbelt.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.democraticunderground.com", "link": "http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=104x2931444", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.abovetopsecret.com", "link": "http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread113980/pg1", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.reddit.com", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/193pbq/til_derek_kieper_an_antiseat_belt_law_advocate/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.omgfacts.com", "link": "http://www.omgfacts.com/lists/5116/An-anti-seat-belt-law-advocate-died-because-he-didn-t-wear-a-seat-belt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.fiberpipe.net", "link": "http://www.fiberpipe.net/~tiktin/Documents/seatbeltskill.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.car-seat.org", "link": "http://www.car-seat.org/showthread.php?t=177175", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3ASeat_belt_legislation", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "fee.org", "link": "http://fee.org/freeman/the-fraud-of-seat-belt-laws/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "unusualdeaths.com", "link": "http://unusualdeaths.com/tag/car-accident/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "unusualdeaths.com", "link": "http://unusualdeaths.com/category/2005/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "unusualdeaths.com", "link": "http://unusualdeaths.com/category/usa/nebraska/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.nsc.org", "link": "http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/Pages/safety-at-home-motor-vehicle-crash.aspx", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.sputnikmusic.com", "link": "http://www.sputnikmusic.com/forums/showthread.php?t=288291", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.quora.com", "link": "https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-a-Seat-Belt-Law-in-the-U-S", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.hg.org", "link": "http://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=27503", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.debate.org", "link": "http://www.debate.org/debates/There-should-not-be-a-mandatory-seatbelt-law/1/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "fazed.net", "link": "http://fazed.net/867", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.john-adams.co.uk", "link": "http://www.john-adams.co.uk/2013/02/12/repeal-the-seat-belt-law/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "www.helmets.org", "link": "http://www.helmets.org/negativs.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.parents.com", "link": "http://www.parents.com/baby/safety/car/car-safety-facts-and-mistakes/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.phoenixazinjurylaw.com", "link": "http://www.phoenixazinjurylaw.com/seat-belts-help-prevent-car-accident-injuries-and-deaths", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.spmhlaw.com", "link": "http://www.spmhlaw.com/auto-accidents.php", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.bobistheoilguy.com", "link": "http://www.bobistheoilguy.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=394101", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.history.com", "link": "http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/unsafe-at-any-speed-hits-bookstores/print", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.skslawyers.com", "link": "http://www.skslawyers.com/InjuryAttorneyNewsAreas.asp?ID=14", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.autoblog.com", "link": "http://www.autoblog.com/2005/01/20/anti-seat-belt-wearer-dies-in-car-accident/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "driveforsafety.goodneighbors.com", "link": "http://driveforsafety.goodneighbors.com/", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "NASCAR champion Tony Stewart hit fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr. at a race track in western New York state on 9 August 2014, fatally injuring Ward.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "The two drivers had been involved in a minor collision moments earlier on the track at Canandaigua Motorsports Park, about 25 miles southeast of Rochester.

high-mileage automobile has been around longer than most of our readers, with a version set it Philadelphia having appeared in a 1948 newspaper. (Even at that time, the story proved unverifiable, with the article's writer identifying it as such and passing it along only as an example of a current rumor sweeping through the community.) Since that early sighting of more than half a century ago, the legend has gone on to enthrall audience after audience as each couple of years sees it pop up anew.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Its origins are as strange as the story itself. Between 1928 and 1935, Charles Nelson Pogue, an inventor from Canada, applied for numerous patents for what he claimed was a new type of carburetor that supposedly completely vaporized gasoline before introducing it to the cylinders, thereby extracting a great deal more energy from the fuel. According to the Pogue patent description, fuel was introduced into the engine in this vaporous \"dry\" state rather than in the normal droplet-laden \"wet\" state, thus combining more readily with air, making it burn with far greater efficiency. Better combustion combined with the raising of the engine's operating temperature from 160 F to 180 F were said to be responsible for vastly improved fuel economy. So much for the techno-talk. The Pogue carburetor was touted as getting 200+ miles to the gallon. Glowing reports about this miracle of ingenuity's making a 1,879 mile trip on 14.5 gallons appeared in the May 1936 issue of Canadian Automotive Trade magazine, reports which Pogue later denied. A manager of a Winnipeg auto dealership claimed he had driven a Pogue-equipped car 217 miles on a gallon of gasoline. A different dealer principal claimed to have driven 26 miles on a pint of fuel. The story snowballed onward from those breathless testimonials as one rumor quickly followed on the heels of another. Thieves were reputed to have broken into Pogue's shop and made off with three of his carburetors. There was talk of armed guards and wolfhounds guarding the shop and the now-famous inventor. Wealthy backers (from Winnipeg or Toronto, depending on whom you heard the story from) were rumored to be bankrolling Pogue, but the arrangements mysteriously fell through. Ford of Canada was said to have bought the invention outright. All in all it was a very exciting time. Alas, one can get by on mere smoke and mirrors for only so long. Those with sense enough to not be deafened by the hyperbole were not long kept at bay with tales of wolfhounds, thieves, and mysterious briefcase-toting moneymen. They wanted to see the carburetor. That, of course, was never permitted. No one reputable was allowed to see the mechanical miracle in action, let alone have a chance to measure its results. After the initial excitement over Pogue's 1936 announcement had faded, more serious types began to openly doubt that the carburetor would work as described. In the December 1936 issue of Automotive Industries magazine, its engineering editor, P.M. Heldt, said of a sketch of the Pogue carburetor: \"The sketch fails to show any features hitherto unknown in carburetor practice, and absolutely gives no warrant for crediting the remarkable results claimed.\" Other journalists were beginning to voice similar opinions. In response to calls to put up or shut up, Pogue's miracle carburetor was heard of no more. Faced with the choice of believing someone had made claims his invention couldn't later live up to or that a monied bad guy had bought up a technology to forever keep it off the market, at least some chose to believe the suppression theory. That the carburetor never made it to the public, they said, was proof enough of its existence. Those 1930s news stories breathlessly trumpeting Pogue's miracle of technology form the basis of the economical carburetor legend now before us. As gas prices fluctuate, our dependence on fossil fuels is driven home time and again. Who wouldn't long for a miracle of engineering that would free us from the tyranny of the gas pump? And thus the groundwork for belief is laid. As sometimes happens in the world of urban legends, desire for something to be true transforms a rumor into certainty that this very thing is fact. Over the years, our legend about a 200 mpg car has bobbed to the surface in community after community, been debunked in numerous respected publications, and bobbed right back up in the wake of those debunkings. The need to believe in this wondrous technology and the evil car manufacturers who are deliberately withholding it from the market appears too strong to combat. A bit of rational thought should be all that's needed to lay this legend to rest. Why would the car manufacturers at all care about keeping such a technological advance away from consumers? Unlike the petroleum companies, they've no vested interest in how much fuel a car uses. An automaker's self interest is best served by getting the newest irresistible technology to the consumer before his competitors do. If any one of them possessed the secret of the 200 mpg car, he'd have rushed it into production, hoping to beat his competitors to the punch. Those who are tempted to believe the Evil Government is responsible for keeping this miracle out of our hands should reflect for a moment on the current state of world politics. The government of the United States would like nothing better than to throw off the yoke of dependence upon foreign oil. A miraculous carburetor would grant that freedom, allowing Americans to continue to enjoy current levels of use without the need to go hat in hand to OPEC or even those dastardly Canadians. The domestic supply would be more than enough. Though rarely is this tale told about anything other than a gas-miserly carburetor, this version describes a miraculous lightbulb: It was around 1920, shortly after he had married, when the old man originally purchased the light bulb from a small store in town. It appeared to be a normal light bulb. However, when after sixty years it was still going strong, he decided to write to the manufacturers and tell them of this remarkable phenomenon. By return a reply came from the company indicating that they were very interested in the bulb and would like to send someone to see it. Eventually, one of the directors of the firm called and, instead of just showing interest, offered to buy it for 1,000. The old man, of course, refused, as the light bulb had given him good service. However, his curiousity was certainly aroused why so much money for his light bulb? The director could provide no plausible explanation as to why they were willing to offer so much for the bulb, so the old man decided to explore this mystery further. With the help of a solicitor friend he did a little investigating and discovered that in the 1920s this particular light-bulb manufacturer had bought and tested the patent for an everlasting bulb. Only a few of these bulbs were made and the company, finding the invention worked, destroyed the bulbs and suppressed the idea after all, it would have put them out of business. Unknown to the company one of the lights had accidentally become mixed up with a batch of ordinary bulbs and this was the light bulb which had lit the old man's kitchen for the past sixty years. (Sometimes lore collides with reality: A long-lived light bulb has been burning since 1901 and currently lights a fire station in Livermore, California.)

(as well as a nice pension, etc.). So he is given permission to select a car from the lot there at the factory. He selects a Chevrolet Caprice, a big, luxury car. After receiving it, he is satisfied with his choice. After all, who wouldn't enjoy driving around in a roomy, comfortable car. After driving it for a while, he noticed something quite odd ... a car like this usually consumes a substantial amount of fuel, but the gas gauge hardly moves at all. After a few weeks, he gets suspicious. Things like this don't happen. Being the company man he is, he returns it to the factory. Explaining this to the service tech must've caused some strange looks, but they took it in anyway. After he got his car back, he noticed it got the typical gas mileage of a comparable car. Could've this car had some secret \"modifications\" that allowed him to drive for weeks, on the same tank of gas? Detroit's automakers have purportedly seized, er.. bought out patents of items that improve gasoline mileage like the 100 mpg carburetor, etc. Maybe the R&D department at GM put this theory to practice, and this was an example. [Collected via e-mail, 1997] A couple journeys from Western Canada to Detroit to buy a new car and presumably save shipping costs while having a vacation in the States at the same time. Driving back to the prairies, they find to their astonishment that the gas gauge is not moving down to \"empty\" even though they've been driving for hours. Arriving home some thousands of miles away from Detroit, they have only refilled the tank once or twice. A few days after returning, the husband looks out at his driveway in the morning to find two mysterious men tinkering with his car (the hood is up). Running out, they race off; he checks under the hood, finds nothing amiss, and concludes it's just vandals or would-be thieves whom he was fortunate to apprehend before any damage was done. BUT, when they drive the car, they find their gas mileage is now normal. Variations: The miraculous car legend ends one of four ways: Mysterious men appear and tinker with the engine, rendering the car no different than any other. The car is reclaimed by the factory. If the owner afterwards gets the same car back (sometimes it's replaced outright with another vehicle), it now gets ordinary gas mileage. No-nonsense business types show up to make a fabulous offer for the car, which is accepted. The owner wakes up one morning to find the car vanished without a trace.", "Last Updated": "26 June 2014", "Credibility": "false", "URL": "www.snopes.com/autos/business/carburetor.asp", "Claim": "A miraculous car that gets 200 miles to the gallon is sold by mistake then reclaimed by the factory and is never seen again.", "Claim_ID": "autos_business_carburetor", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/autos/business/carburetor.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.facebook.com", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/snopes/posts/462833697194488", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.toledoblade.com", "link": "http://www.toledoblade.com/Opinion/2008/12/09/Miracle-carburetor-legend-still-gets-mileage.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.lxsh.club", "link": "http://www.lxsh.club/200+MPG+Carburetor+Blueprints.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "ideas.businesxxl.com", "link": "http://ideas.businesxxl.com/business-ideas-on-fuel/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "cars-onlines.com", "link": "http://cars-onlines.com/200mpg-cars/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "blog.hemmings.com", "link": "http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2007/05/01/big-oil-conspiracy-376-mpg-opel-uncovered/comment-page-1/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.vimeoinfo.com", "link": "http://www.vimeoinfo.com/video/55048655/nobodys-fuel", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.bbc.com", "link": "http://www.bbc.com/news/special/2014/newsspec_8703/index.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "gas2.org", "link": "http://gas2.org/2009/07/13/students-build-hydrogen-vehicle-that-gets-1336-mpg/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Archives/Science/2010_October_23", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.encyclopedia.com", "link": "http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Greece.aspx", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.mpoweruk.com", "link": "http://www.mpoweruk.com/history.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.imdb.com", "link": "http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0034093/quotes", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "reneweconomy.com.au", "link": "http://reneweconomy.com.au/2015/toyota-vs-tesla-can-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles-compete-with-evs-60374", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "link": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3106032/Speak-like-Tarzan-don-t-embarrassed-aim-make-200-mistakes-day-Irish-polyglot-reveals-learn-language-just-three-months.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.orange-papers.org", "link": "http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-propaganda.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "helloreverb.com", "link": "https://helloreverb.com/share/interest/Automotive%20Industries", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "fallout.wikia.com", "link": "http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:Will_Civilization_and_the_World_build_back_to_the_old_days_and_be_back_to_normal_again%3F", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.princeton.edu", "link": "https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/browse/term-graph.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "e360.yale.edu", "link": "http://e360.yale.edu/content/digestlist.msp/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "granta.com", "link": "http://granta.com/second-nature/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.wesjones.com", "link": "http://www.wesjones.com/sugar1.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.antipope.org", "link": "http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2015/12/science-fictional-shibboleths.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.thecoolhunter.net", "link": "http://www.thecoolhunter.net/cloud/view/Vilnius", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "benfry.com", "link": "http://benfry.com/writing/treemap/equator.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.scribd.com", "link": "https://www.scribd.com/doc/3247883/diccionario-ingles-espanol", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "Many a product has gone through the life cycle of development, marketing, and then eventual obsolescence when its manufacturer determined it no longer sold well enough to justify continued production or decided to focus on offering a newer and better version. Upon occasion, however, a discontinued product has retained a strong enough following among a devoted group of aficionados for another company to venture licensing or purchasing the rights from the original manufacturer and resuming production. (One example of this phenomenon occurred when INTV bought the rights to the Intellivision video game system from Mattel, selling off old inventory and then producing new consoles and game cartridges.)", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "That's the basic idea behind this tale from the original (1975) edition of The People's Almanac , about a group of disenchanted General Motors stylists who left the company and spent ten years between 1958 and 1967 cranking out a few hundred thousand copies of the discontinued 1957 model Chevrolet at a small, private plant in Illinois but the kicker is that they supposedly did all this without the knowledge, cooperation, or consent of General Motors. The story seems a fairly obvious bit of humor chock full of tongue-in-cheek jabs at the auto industry (especially evident in the closing reference to Volkswagen's supposed interest in opening a U.S. plant to produce 1973 Buick Rivieras this was written in 1975, shortly after the Riviera had also undergone a significant and much-criticized design change), but its inclusion in a reference work with no external indicator of its fictional status has led many readers in the years since to take it seriously. For those who prefer a more thorough debunking, we highlight a few of the tale's many implausibilities below: We have found no mention whatsoever of \"Ardell Malowick\" or his scheme of producing '57 Chevies in any source outside of The People's Almanac; not a single book, newspaper, or magazine article about either subject (save for those that simply reference the original People's Almanac story). We've contacted a number of vintage car clubs, including ones that specialize in Chevrolet automobiles from the 1950s, and have yet to find a single person who has owned or seen (even in photographs) one of the faux '57 Chevies, anyone who worked in a dealership that sold them, any mechanic who ever serviced one of them, or anybody employed by the plant that supposedly produced them. The phony Chevy plant in Illinois reportedly turned out 200,000 automobiles in a ten-year period that's 400 cars a week, every week, for ten years! Where did a small group former GM workers raise the capital to start up and run such a massive (and illicit) manufacturing venture, all within the space of a few months? How did the plant's owners/operators, all their employees, and all the auto dealerships engaged in selling the faux '57 Chevies account for the expenses, revenues, income, and taxes associated with a product they couldn't legally make or offer for sale? How did dealers manage to sell, without anyone's noticing, a few hundred thousand cars for which they could establish no valid history or chain of ownership, and which could not be traced by serial number or other identifier to a legitimate manufacturer? We don't know how this tale ended up being published in The People's Almanac : whether the compilers decided to include bit of drollery in the book as lark, or a prankish writer managed to slip a gag past unsuspecting editors, or a gullible researcher was taken in by a tall tale. But the story is indeed a joke, and, judging by the results, a good one at that. In honor of the 50th anniversary of the classic automobile's introduction, CARS Inc. announced in 2006 that they would begin offering newly-[re]built (from original cowls) 1957 Chevrolet convertibles.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.1957chevybody.com/;http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/buick-riviera/buick-riviera-history.shtml;http://www.57classicchevy.com/;http://www.intellivisiongames.com/history.asp;", "Example": "The 1957 Chevrolet was introduced by General Motors in late 1956, as part of their special Labor Day Sneak Preview of New Cars. The '57 Chevy sported nonfunctional tail fins and excess side trim like most American cars of that era, and it would have passed into obscurity except for the amazing popularity of the design in the years that followed. While the Chevy's competitors disappeared into the junkyards of the nation, the '57 throve, particularly the 2-door Bel-Air model. The car became a favorite of customizers in Southern California, and its popularity spread across the nation. The '57 Chevy has been almost as visible on the highways of America as the Volkswagen, particularly in California and the Midwest. In 1965, the California Department of Motor Vehicles listed 35,000 '57 Chevies on the road an astounding survival rate for an American car (although in 1957, Chevrolet enjoyed total sales of 775,000 units). No other American automobile has survived the years with equal fortitude. However, no other American automobile, with the exception of the limited-production Studebaker Avanti, has enjoyed the unique production facilities of the '57 Chevy. There have been subsequent designs for subsequent Chevrolet model years, but the '57, unlike any other American car and contrary to American industrial practice, enjoyed a manufacturer's run of 10 years. A dedicated group of ex-Chevrolet stylists and franchised used-car salesmen continued to turn out close to 200,000 1957 Chevrolets, focusing on the 2-door Bel-Air model, between the years 1957 and 1967, in a small auto assembly plant located outside Jacksonville, Ill. The enthusiasts, led by ex-General Motors stylist Ardell Malowick, quit GM in mid-1957 when it was learned, to nobody's surprise, that the 1957 design was to be scrapped in favor of the longer, lower, wider '58 Chevy, which replaced the '57's peaked fins with contoured, sublimated fins. Malowick and his associates quickly decamped and purchased their own auto assembly facilities in southern Illinois. However, Malowick was unable to finance the die molds and giant steel presses which GM and Fisher Auto Body used to construct the basic body; rather, Malowick relied on the proved European coach-building technique of pounding body shape out by hand over wooden molds, formed from fiber-glass replicas of the real thing. In this way, some of the imperfections of Fisher's mass production were eliminated. Malowick and associates knew that Chevrolet, which held all legal rights to the design, would not consent to the manufacture of '57 Chevies to compete with their '58s and subsequent models. Perhaps GM was aware, as Malowick now contends, that subsequent models could never compete with the '57 for purity of design. Because of legal restrictions, the post-1957 new '57 Chevies built by Malowick were sold as remarkably well-preserved used cars in car lots across the U.S. In the sale of these cars, Malowick enjoyed the clandestine cooperation of countless used-car merchants throughout the nation who were in sympathy with his cause. Certainly, used car dealers sought Malowick's creations with a fervor they have not displayed for any other American vehicle before or since. Malowick was able to survive financially by his relatively high wholesale price, and a low overhead provided in part by engines and chassis pirated from Chrysler warehouses in northern Illinois (accounting partially for Chrysler's bewildering stock nose dive during and immediately after their \"forward look\" phase), and from sales to special collectors and customizers, mostly in California, who were willing to pay anything for a '57 Chevy in good condition. By far Malowick's most successful model was, of course, the 2-door Bel Air with the metallic plum paint, many which can be seen on the streets of most American cities today. In 1967, Malowick was forced to close down shop because of rising costs and the rumors that General Motors was wise to his operations and was preparing legal action. Malowick has since gone into the business of manufacturing denim boots and book bags, but he is considering another automobile operation if he can locate favorable conditions, possibly in Germany. There is a rumor that the giant Volkswagen Corporation, which has thought about opening a factory in the U.S., has made overtures to Malowick regarding the 1973 Buick Riviera, another classic of American design.", "Last Updated": "9 October 2013", "Credibility": "false", "URL": "www.snopes.com/autos/dream/57chevy.asp", "Claim": "A group of former General Motors workers furtively produced 1957 Chevrolet automobiles on their own for ten years.", "Claim_ID": "autos_dream_57chevy", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/autos/dream/57chevy.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/autos/dream/dream.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/search/?q=U.S.%20soldiers%20rape%20boys%20in%20front%20of%20their%20mothers&sort=relevance&order=desc&page=64", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "twitter.com", "link": "http://twitter.com/#!/snopes/status/11289983335", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "camelopardid2.rssing.com", "link": "http://camelopardid2.rssing.com/chan-1192507/all_p1.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "xishui.co", "link": "http://xishui.co/tag/car-dealers-contoured-creations", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.9-11themotherofallblackoperations.blogspot.com", "link": "http://www.9-11themotherofallblackoperations.blogspot.com/2010_02_01_archive.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.texasmonthly.com", "link": "http://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/o-janis/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "www.carlustblog.com", "link": "http://www.carlustblog.com/hafner.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "blog.hemmings.com", "link": "http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2012/04/24/driving-away-cancer-a-50-state-odyssey-begins/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "therealafricanhousewifehomeandaway.wordpress.com", "link": "https://therealafricanhousewifehomeandaway.wordpress.com/opinion/opinion/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "archive.org", "link": "https://archive.org/stream/The_Times_News_Idaho_Newspaper_1967_08_25/The_Times_News_Idaho_Newspaper_1967_08_25_djvu.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "archive.org", "link": "https://archive.org/stream/whitinspindle1961unse/whitinspindle1961unse_djvu.txt", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.gizmag.com", "link": "http://www.gizmag.com/abrasive-weeding/41443/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "github.com", "link": "https://github.com/robennals/think-link/blob/master/ruby/snopesclaims.csv", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.academia.edu", "link": "http://www.academia.edu/3790697/Retro_THE_CULTURE_OF_REVIVAL", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.erudit.org", "link": "https://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/2014/v25/n1/1032799ar.pdf", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "zineweb.com", "link": "http://zineweb.com/?cat=5", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.joesherlock.com", "link": "http://www.joesherlock.com/Book-Reviews4.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "weaponsman.com", "link": "http://weaponsman.com/?cat=32&paged=9", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "ufdc.ufl.edu", "link": "http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00010883/02396", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "aebrain.blogspot.com", "link": "http://aebrain.blogspot.com/2007_12_01_archive.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.alniva.be", "link": "http://www.alniva.be/corgi/corgi_historiek.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.bibliotecapleyades.net", "link": "http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/world_order/WorldCh07-1.htm", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "This is a windfall legend, pure and simple, a tale of an ordinary Joe's being in the right place at the right time to have good fortune handed to him. We want to believe in the legendary Harley because then we can believe magic could touch any of us at any time. And in that lies the key to this legend's tellability.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Most often this legend is told about a machine inscribed \"To Elvis, Love, Priscilla,\" but sometimes the bike is said to have been a gift from Elvis to James Dean. How much was paid for it is also subject to variation; anything from $300,000 to $2.2 million has been mentioned. The buyer is either said to be the Harley-Davidson Company or Jay Leno (of \"Tonight Show\" fame). (An Elvis Presley-James Dean pairing is rather unlikely because at the time of James Dean's death in an automobile accident on 30 September 1955, neither young man was yet a major entertainment figure. The two films that propelled James Dean to stardom, Giant and Rebel Without a Cause , were released posthumously, and in September 1955 Elvis Presley was still largely a regional act, recording for a small Memphis-based record label and playing live shows around the South at venues that included high school gyms. At that point in his career, Elvis would probably not have lavished such an expensive gift on someone who was then only a relatively minor TV and film star.) Jay Leno has categorically stated his only connection with this tall tale is people asking him about it: Have you heard the story about the Rockingham County farmer who bought an old Harley-Davidson motorcycle at a yard sale and discovered \"To Elvis, Love Priscilla\" written under the seat? Then he sold it to Jay Leno, late-night talk show host, who handed over $1 million for the bike? Well, Leno has heard it. \"Yesterday, I got a call that it was an old farmer in Pennsylvania that had it,\" he said. \"Then, two weeks ago, Texas Monthly magazine called because I'd bought it from a farmer (there).\" Leno has one thing to say: \"I don't buy show-business memorabilia.\" In 2000, Leno said he had been getting a couple of calls a week for the past six to eight months about the story, which he called \"an urban fairy tale\" perpetuated, in part, by the Internet. On 22 January during that evening's airing of The Tonight Show , he once again disclaimed the rumor. Additionally, Todd Morgan, a spokesman at Graceland in Memphis, said none of the long-lost Harley stories was true. If not Leno, maybe the Harley-Davidson Company bought the bike? Nope. They've less need than anyone to buy an Elvis motorcycle now, because they already have one. A 1956 Harley-Davidson KH that belonged to The King and was purchased from Fleming Horne by Harley-Davidson in 1995 is now housed at their archive facility in Milwaukee. Elvis had other motorcycles too, five of which (four Harleys and one Honda) are at the Graceland Museum in Memphis, Tennessee. Harley-Davidson has lots of fun trying to set people straight about this legend. A 1996 newspaper article relates the difficulties they've had: First, the undead Elvis was seen all across America. A St. Louis housewife even saw the King at a movie theater here. I read that in a supermarket tabloid, so I know it's true. Now Elvis' Harley is turning up all around the USA. The King's hog brings fabulous wealth to the fan who finds it. I'm proud to say I have the Harley bike story worth the most money $4 million. That number is confirmed by the Harley-Davidson folks. I heard the story from my friend Richard, who believes it is true. \"This could only happen in America,\" he said. Here is Richard's story: \"This friend of a friend of my daughter was riding along a back road, when he saw an old motorcycle for sale,\" Richard said. \"It was a 1950s Harley for $600. The bike needed work, but he bought it. \"He couldn't get parts, the bike was so old. So he called Harley headquarters in Milwaukee. He described the Harley. He kept getting transferred from person to person. Each time, they'd ask what the Harley looked like. \"Finally, the CEO of Harley came on the line. He asked the guy to describe the Harley again. Then he told him to go out and check under the rear fender. That's where he found an inscription beginning, 'To Elvis ...' \"It was Elvis' Harley-Davidson, a gift from somebody. Harley offered him $4 million for it. \"Imagine that,\" Richard said. \"Four million dollars for a bike he found by the road. It's like winning the lottery.\" Is there a chance in a million that this story is true? Elvis collectibles go for major money. His 1969 American Express card was auctioned for $41,400. And it was expired. Elvis only held it in his hand. Think what you could get for something he'd wrapped his legs around. Elvis did ride Harleys, and he rode them hard. Lamar Fike, a member of the Memphis Mafia Elvis' entourage says he and Elvis used to ride their Harleys 110 miles an hour on what is now Elvis Presley Boulevard. One misty afternoon in 1957, they had to slow down for a bus. Lamar and his Harley slid under the bus. Lamar was lucky. He only lost some leather off his jacket. He lived to tell this story to Alanna Nash for her book, Elvis Aaron Presley. Elvis' Harley was untouched. Was it the one Richard's friend of a friend found on a back road? Richard tried to find the new Harley millionaire for me. \"He was the friend of other friends,\" Richard said. \"Nobody knows his name.\" If I just got $4 million, I'd keep my name quiet, too. Richard was sure Harley-Davidson would remember this high-priced buy. I called Harley headquarters in Milwaukee and got transferred from person to person, just like the guy in the story. I didn't end up with the Harley CEO. I got Nola Vander Meulen with Harley public relations. \"We've received so many calls on the Elvis Harley,\" she said. Is the story true? \"No, it's an urban legend. We hear about it all the time, from all over. Usually the Harley is found in a barn or bought at a garage sale. The buyer lifts up the seat or looks at the fender and sees this inscription: 'To Elvis, from Priscilla.' Most stories say we buy it for anywhere from half a million to a million dollars. You came up with the most money.\" There is some truth to the tale. \"We did purchase Elvis' very own personal Harley,\" Nola said. \"But it belonged to a collector who knew what it was. The bike was well documented.\" How much did Harley pay for it? \"I don't know, and if I did, I couldn't say.\" Four million dollars? I asked. Nola laughed and laughed, which I took for a no. The Harley bike story does skid by the truth. But the actual facts are a King-sized disappointment. The legendary Elvis deserves better. I can only hope that somewhere there is an undiscovered Harley. I'll ask Elvis, next time he's in town to see a movie. A similar tale circulates concerning country singer Hank Williams, who died of a heart attack on New Year s Day of 1953 while sleeping in the back seat of his Cadillac: A guy is walking alone one night and sees a parked car with a man passed out in the backseat. The window is unrolled and the man manages to swipe the backseat sleeper's large white hat. The next morning he hears that Hank Williams was found dead in the backseat of a car. The man flips the hat upside-down only to notice the letters \"H.W.\" inscribed in the rim. Hank Williams's hat was never found and to this day it sits in this guy's closet. (Though the Elvis Harley tale isn't one of them, some windfall legends turn out to be true. One bargain hunter struck pay dirt when he bought a painting for $4 at the local flea market.

There's something about cars and solid rocket fuel engines that draws them to this tale like happy moths to an unforgiving flame. Maybe it's the Wile E. Coyote-ness of it all, the \"so real you can almost touch it\" mental image of a smoldering wreck sticking out of a cliff face. Perhaps it's the vicarious enjoyment of a Tim Allen-ish \"More Power!\" fantasy carried to its fatal yet hilarious conclusion. Or maybe it's a simple matter of cars and the men who love them, the eternal love affair.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Whatever. The boys love it, and that's all that matters. This tale of vehicular velocity ferocity has been popular among servicemen since the late 1970s. In those early word-of-mouth versions, the JATO was taken from a cargo plane or out of a warehouse on base, thereby answering a key question left up in the air in later versions: Where did the intrepid lad obtain the engine? The story is even older than that. One of our readers says he heard it in 1961 or 1962. In that version, two JATO units mounted as \"lakers\" (exhaust pipes) on a 1940 Ford were fired on Bayshore freeway while trying to outrun the California Highway Patrol. The car was last seen going end over end across San Francisco bay. Another reader heard it in 1964 while stationed at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. In that version, the unmanned JATO'd car went airborne and smashed into a tree, destroying both car and plant. The version we now know and love (complete with puzzled police and the smoldering wreck of what's left of a car impacted into the face of a cliff), began making the cyberspatial rounds in 1990. In 1992 the incident was said to have happened in New Mexico, with the car being a Plymouth Road Runner. By 1994 the car had transformed itself into a Chevrolet Impala, but now the accident's venue was California. (See how these things mutate over time?) 1995 saw this legend just about take over the Internet as it was flashed from e-mail to e-mail as \"this year's Darwin Award winner.\" It's this version which is still in circulation today, the car frozen in time as a Chevy Impala, the location given as somewhere in Arizona. As it appeared in 1995: \"Darwin award\" Nominee: You all know about the Darwin awards it's an annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way. Last year's winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke(tm) machine, which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it. And for this year's nominee, the story is: The Arizona (U.S.) Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road, on the outside of a curve. The wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it was a car. The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene. The boys in the lab finally figured out what it was, and what had happened. It seems that a guy had somehow got hold of a JATO unit, (Jet Assisted Take Off, actually a solid-fuel rocket) that is used to give heavy military transport planes an extra `push' for taking off from short airfields. He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert, and found a long, straight stretch of road. Then he attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, got up some speed, and fired off the JATO!! Best as they could determine, he was doing somewhere between 250 and 300 mph (350-420kph) when he came to that curve ... The brakes were completely burned away, apparently from trying to slow the car. TODAY'S LESSON: Solid-fuel rockets don't have an 'off' switch . . . Nor, so it seems, do good stories. A spokesman of the Arizona Department of Public Safety stated in a 1996 newspaper article the JATO story wasn't true though they continued to get asked about it. \"We get a call on that about every 90 days,'' said Dave Myers. ''It keeps us on the map.'' There are two fatal problems with the JATO story. First, anybody who understood the extreme forces involved well enough to attach a JATO unit to a car so that it would keep the car going in a straight line (rather than immediately spinning around) would probably know better than to do it in the first place. Second, the Arizona Highway Patrol has a phone number. A call to them will confirm they've both heard the story and no, it's not true. Sorry, fellas. Though the legend of the smoldering Chevy smashed into a cliff face is pure fabrication, JATO engines have been mounted on cars on a couple of occasions. As reported in Motor Trend in 1957, Dodge took a brand-new car out to El Mirage dry lake bed in California, removed the gas tank, and mounted a JATO unit in its place. (The intent was to test the car's brakes and to film the event for TV commercials.) The car went 140 mph. Barbara \"cliff unhanger\" Mikkelson", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "", "Example": "[Collected on the Internet, 1995] The Arizona Highway Patrol were mystified when they came upon a pile of smoldering wreckage embedded in the side of a cliff rising above the road at the apex of a curve. The metal debris resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it turned out to be the vaporized remains of an automobile. The make of the vehicle was unidentifiable at the scene. The folks in the lab finally figured out what it was, and pieced together the events that led up to its demise. It seems that a former Air Force sergeant had somehow got hold of a JATO (Jet Assisted Take-Off) unit. JATO units are solid fuel rockets used to give heavy military transport airplanes an extra push for take-off from short airfields. Dried desert lakebeds are the location of choice for breaking the world ground vehicle speed record. The sergeant took the JATO unit into the Arizona desert and found a long, straight stretch of road. He attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, accelerated to a high speed, and fired off the rocket. The facts, as best as could be determined, are as follows: The operator was driving a 1967 Chevy Impala. He ignited the JATO unit approximately 3.9 miles from the crash site. This was established by the location of a prominently scorched and melted strip of asphalt. The vehicle quickly reached a speed of between 250 and 300 mph and continued at that speed, under full power, for an additional 20-25 seconds. The soon-to-be pilot experienced G-forces usually reserved for dog-fighting F-14 jocks under full afterburners. The Chevy remained on the straight highway for approximately 2.6 miles (15-20 seconds) before the driver applied the brakes, completely melting them, blowing the tires, and leaving thick rubber marks on the road surface. The vehicle then became airborne for an additional 1.3 miles, impacted the cliff face at a height of 125 feet, and left a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the rock. Most of the driver's remains were not recovered; however, small fragments of bone, teeth, and hair were extracted from the crater, and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel.", "Last Updated": "12 November 2006", "Credibility": "false", "URL": "www.snopes.com/autos/dream/jato.asp", "Claim": "The remains of a smoldering JATO-equipped Chevrolet Impala were found embedded in the side of a cliff in the Arizona desert.", "Claim_ID": "autos_dream_jato", "Tags": "", "Google Results": [{"results": [{"domain": "www.snopes.com", "link": "http://www.snopes.com/autos/dream/jato.asp", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JATO_Rocket_Car", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "darwinawards.com", "link": "http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin1995-04.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.fictionresource.com", "link": "http://www.fictionresource.com/sgaurban/legends.php?search=url&value=autos", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.pistonheads.com", "link": "http://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&t=753096&d=10864.52426&nmt=", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "riko.setiaku.co", "link": "http://riko.setiaku.co/video-jato.xhtml", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.proxywhore.com", "link": "http://www.proxywhore.com/invboard/index.php?showtopic=292723&st=45", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "esmuy.mx", "link": "http://esmuy.mx/?query=%20Jato%20&lang=mx-MX", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.tomatopages.com", "link": "http://www.tomatopages.com/folsomforum/index.php?showtopic=22687", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "letschatmusic.com", "link": "http://letschatmusic.com/get/124971404/dream-map-myth.html", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "musickade.com", "link": "http://musickade.com/mp3/music-jato", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "forums.autosport.com", "link": "http://forums.autosport.com/topic/195542-acme-jet-powered-railroad-car-co/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.jbslemmer.com", "link": "http://www.jbslemmer.com/darwins.htm", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "musikalisch.net", "link": "http://musikalisch.net/download/mp3/a-carmageddon-christmas.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "wichitascca.org", "link": "http://wichitascca.org/pipermail/wichita-scca_wichitascca.org/2009-January/004402.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "wellequipped.blogspot.com", "link": "http://wellequipped.blogspot.com/2006_12_01_archive.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "infinityoverzero.wordpress.com", "link": "https://infinityoverzero.wordpress.com/tag/jato/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.teamshelby.com", "link": "http://www.teamshelby.com/forums/index.php/topic/39298-the-mother-of-all-mods/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.topaks.ir", "link": "http://www.topaks.ir/key/jaton-corporation/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.goftavard.ga", "link": "http://www.goftavard.ga/c/JATO/", "link_type": "results"}]}, {"results": [{"domain": "m00cow007.tripod.com", "link": "http://m00cow007.tripod.com/id2.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.funny.co.uk", "link": "http://www.funny.co.uk/real-life/the-darwin-awards-a-complete-archive/", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.tumblr.com", "link": "https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/ground-vehicle", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "humour.bluehaze.com.au", "link": "http://humour.bluehaze.com.au/show.php?wk=2015_10_09", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.seanet.com", "link": "http://www.seanet.com/~owenmp/cwin/is0108.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "forum.pl-vacc.org", "link": "http://forum.pl-vacc.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=3895", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "michalnezamyka.warthogterritory.net", "link": "http://michalnezamyka.warthogterritory.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=5502&p=44745", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "forums.plentyoffish.com", "link": "https://forums.plentyoffish.com/usermessages.aspx?user_Id=989939", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.crusher-mining.com", "link": "http://www.crusher-mining.com/wiki/impala-mining-plants.html", "link_type": "results"}, {"domain": "www.findeen.es", "link": "http://www.findeen.es/jatp,1.html", "link_type": "results"}]}]}, {"Origins": "Judging from the entries made on one police blotter after another, cars around the nation are having their gas tanks sugared by those whom their owners have displeased. Why is this happening? Because, according to widespread belief, sugar poured into a gas tank will turn into a poor man's version of liquid cement and quickly render the vehicle's engine unfit for anything but a junkyard. In theory, the sugar dissolves into the gasoline, then travels along the fuel lines into the engine, where the heat of the vehicle's operations melts the sweetener into a dense sludge that gets into every nook and cranny of the engine. The sucrosed engine seizes and halts the vehicle in its tracks, but the real damage comes when the engine cools and the sludge hardens to rock-like consistency. Only the replacement of the entire engine will render the car fit for use again, says popular wisdom; otherwise, it's kiss your jalopy goodbye.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "It is for such reason that this theory is so fervently cherished it appears to grant, for the price of a 5 lb. bag of sugar, the ability to effect great and irreparable harm to an adversary's most prized possession. The touted mode of vengeance is both inexpensive and easy to carry out, a combination that seems to put the power of getting even into the hands of anyone, no matter how disadvantaged. However, revenge fantasies aside, this snippet of popular lore turns out not to be the sure and deadly car killer the retribution-minded would want to believe it is. As with many grand schemes, it lives more vividly in its imagining than in reality. Sugar doesn't dissolve in gasoline, as a researcher at Berkeley confirmed in 1994. Forensics professor John Thornton labeled sucrose with radioactive carbon atoms and mixed it with gasoline, then spun the concoction in a centrifuge. After the undissolved particles were removed, the liquid's radiation level was measured to determine how much sucrose had become part of the gasoline. The answer was extremely little: the equivalent of less than a teaspoonful per 15-gallon tank of gas. Because sugar doesn't dissolve in automotive fuel, it doesn't carmelize, and so it does not turn into the debilitating gunk this well-known entry in the revenge canon calls for. Instead, sugar poured into a car's gas tank stays intact. While sugar could still cause harm if it reached the engine (but in the same way sand would, by virtue of its being a granular contaminant, not because the sugar would turn into a syrup), even that potential harm is generally prevented by filtration. At the end of the pickup tube in the gas tank is a \"sock\" that blocks solid materials, so the fuel gets through, but precious little that's not liquid does. Further up the line is the fuel filter, and what may have got through the \"sock\" does not get past it. Yet, even though the sugar will not reach the engine in either syrup or solid state, it can clog the fuel filter or the fuel injectors, a circumstance which could stop a car. A little sugar in the tank could be dealt with by no more than having to change the fuel filter a few times, but a heavier sugaring would require the gas tank be removed from the car and dumped out. Tom and Ray Magliozzi (the hosts of radio's Car Talk ) say it's not a big job for a good mechanic to drop the tank and clean it out; the process would likely cost the car's owner somewhere between $100 and $200. Though $100 to $200 is an appreciable sum, it is a far cry from the wished-for outcome of forcing the victim to have to replace the engine or scrap the car. Ironically, there may soon come a day when each of us happily puts sugar in our gas tanks. In 2002 researchers at the University of Wisconsin at Madison happened upon a relatively easy way to extract hydrogen from a glucose solution: heat the sugar solution to 392 F and pass it over a platinum-based catalyst to break it down into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The resultant hydrogen could then be directed into a fuel cell that would power a car, with the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. The potential for using sugar to fuel cars doesn't end with the notion of using the hydrogen extracted from glucose solutions. In 2004 researchers at Sandia National Labs began applying for patents covering ways to convert the glucose itself into energy, with an eye to using the sugar itself as a fuel source. Yet the science of the matter aside, we expect reports of sugared gas tanks to continue to appear on police blotters everywhere for as long as gasoline engines power cars. The desire for revenge runs strong so strong that it will not let such a little thing as facts get in its way. Accordingly, the best way to gain revenge on someone through the \"sugar in the gas tank\" prank might be to simply play on the belief rather than the reality just sprinkle a fair amount of sugar on the ground beneath the opening to the fuel tank of your victim's car and leave an empty sugar sack in a conspicious spot near the vehicle. Then sit back and watch your victim go wild trying to figure out how to deal with all that sugar he assumes is now in his gas tank.

on the Internet in 1999. Though both versions of the original Internet warning alluded to an accident in Indonesia wherein a driver was burned and his car badly damaged as a result of such an explosion, no reports ever surfaced in the news media to confirm the incident. Moreover, nothing turned up about similar explosions in other countries. If sparks from cell phones were touching off conflagrations at gas pumps around the world, as suggested at the time, the phenomenon escaped the media's notice. Such rumors were furthered in May 1999 when a lengthy article appeared in the Bangkok Post supporting this warning. It mentioned \"a recent report in the China Post newspaper\" and from there proceeded to parrot the warning given in the longer example quoted above, complete with reference to the report by Shell Chemicals on the injuries suffered by the man in Indonesia and the Chinese Petroleum Corporation's instructions to filling stations to get drivers to switch off their phones while fueling.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Okay, so the bit about a guy in Indonesia being turned into a human fireball didn't stand up. But what about persistent rumors concerning another supposed victim, this time an Australian man, supposedly done in by using his mobile phone as he refueled? Although in 1999 oil companies told the South China Morning Post they had heard reports of an Australian man being blown up recently when his phone rang as he was filling his car with gasoline, fire service heads in Australia insist the incident never happened. As for incidents elsewhere in the world, after several reports were circulated in the United States claiming mobile phones had been blamed for fires at gas stations, both the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) and the American Petroleum Institute issued statements denying the risk. The CTIA said, \"There is no evidence whatsoever that a wireless phone has ever caused ignition or explosion at a station anywhere in the world. Wireless phones don't cause gas stations to blow up. Warnings being posted in petrol stations simply perpetuate the myth.\" The American Petroleum Institute said, \"We can find no evidence of someone using a cellphone causing any kind of accident, no matter how small, at a gas station anywhere in the world.\" In June 2002 another authoritative-sounding warning on this subject began circulating on the Internet: The Shell Oil Company recently issued a warning about three incidents where Mobile Phones have ignited fumes while being answered or ringing during fueling operations. What specifically happened Case 1 The phone was placed on the car's trunk lid during fueling, it rang and the ensuing fire destroyed the car and the gasoline pump. Case 2 An individual suffered severe burns to their face when fumes ignited as they answered a call while refueling their car. Case 3 An individual suffered burns to the thigh and groin as fumes ignited when the phone, which was in their pocket, rang while they were fueling their car. What should you learn from this? It is a misconception that Mobile Phones are intrinsically safe and can't ignite fuel/fumes. Mobile phones that light up when switched on, or when they ring, have enough energy released to provide a spark for ignition. Mobile phones should not be used in filling stations, or when fueling lawn mowers, boats etc. Mobile phones should not be used around other materials that generate flammable or explosive fumes or dust (i.e. solvents, chemicals, gases, grain dust etc.). Mobile phones should be turned off before entering an area where other materials that generate flammable or explosive fumes or dust is located. Please share this with employees who do not have access to email, family members and friends to help keep everyone safe. Though we looked long and hard, we never found documentation confirming any of the three incidents described in the that warning. Moreover, Shell denied having issued a warning of this nature: We understand that there is an email, purportedly official Shell communication, circulating which describes various incidents that are supposed to have occurred as a result of mobile phones ringing while at a retail station. Please be advised that the email in question does NOT originate from Shell Malaysia and we are unable to confirm any of the incidents quoted. There was a warning memo which originated at a Shell loading station in California, but it was issued only to caution employees about the potential dangers of static-related hazards at fueling stations; it said nothing about cell phones touching off fires. (The \"three incidents\" e-mail quoted above was teamed with a separate warning about the hazards posed by static electricity, a topic covered on our Static Quo page.) Okay, so it hasn't happened yet. Is there still a potential, as yet unrealized risk in using cell phones while refueling? According to some experts, there is a danger that using a mobile phone near gas pumps could touch off an explosion, but not only have we found no real-life instances of such an explosion occurring, we don't know anyone who has demonstrated experimentally that it's even possible (including the folks at The Discovery Channel's Mythbusters program). Even so, gas pumps in Australia bear stickers cautioning motorists to turn off their phones while refueling; Shell in Malaysia has affixed similar stickers to each of its gas pumps; numerous pumps in the U.S.A. are similarly adorned; Canada's major gas pump operators have banned customers from using mobile phones while at the gas pump; and in 1999 the city of Cicero, Illinois, passed the first law in the USA banning the use of cellular phones at gas stations. All of this activity was in the nature of CYA cautions rather than a response to a documented hazard. Cellular phone manufacturers Nokia and Ericsson have said the risk is very small that something will happen when one uses a cell phone at a gas station, but since there is a risk, it should be counted. Nokia also said that the company has been recommending for a long time that mobile phones should be turned off while the car is being refueled. What it is about a cellular phone that could possibly trigger an explosion is difficult to fathom, however. The claim that the batteries used in a cellular phone can ignite gasoline seems specious, since cellular phone batteries are the same voltage as automobile batteries (12V D.C.) but deliver far less current. Likewise, the claim that a \"cellular phone ringer uses more than 100 volts for excitation\" is a curious artifact of the \"regular\" telephone era: cellular phones don't have ringers; they produce audio tones that simulate the sound of a ringing telephone. News reports routinely attribute gas pump fires to cell phone use whenever a fire occurs at a service station where such a phone was in use at the time, and police and firefighters at the scene often simply assume the connection between the two to be valid. Later investigations, however, have always shown in such cases that the press reports were wrong, that something else (usually a discharge of static electricity) touched off the fires, and the presence of cell phones was coincidental rather than causal.

All the electronic devices in gas stations are protected with explosive containment devices, (intrinsically safe) while cell phones are not. READ YOUR HANDBOOK! Mobile phone makers Motorola, Ericsson, and Nokia, all print cautions in their user handbooks that warn against mobile phones in \"gas stations, fuel storage sites, and chemical factories.\" Exxon has begun placing \"warning stickers\" at its gasoline stations. The threat mobile phones pose to gas stations and their users is primarily the result of their ability to produce sparks that can be generated by the high-powered battery inside the phone. Please pass this on. [Collected on the Internet, 1999] *** PASS THIS ON TO ALL YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS *** Mobile phones an explosive risk at gas stations. Switch off your mobile phone while filling your car. This is the latest advice for mobile phone users and gas station attendants alike from the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), which has recently informed all its affiliates to be on alert for people chatting on mobiles while pumping gas, a practice it asserts can cause explosions. \"There have been several explosions in Southeast Asia and Europe and we hope similar tragedies can be avoided in Taiwan,\" said David Tung from CPC's main engineering division. According to a report released by Shell Chemicals, a driver in Indonesia suffered burns and his car was severely damaged when petrol vapor exploded after being ignited by static electricity from the mobile phone he was using. Apparently, the driver had been talking on a mobile phone as a gas station attendant filled his car with petrol. When the driver bent down close to the petrol tank to check whether it was full, the vapor exploded. In Belgium, customers have been prohibited from using mobile phones within 10 meters of gas stations and warnings are posted everywhere to remind people of the danger, according to a Belgian newspaper. The threat mobile phones pose to gas stations and their users around the world is largely due to their ability to produce sparks. These can be generated by the high-powered battery inside the phone, which is itself, a possible cause of fire. But the electromagnetic waves emitted by the phone are more than sufficient to create considerable static electricity that heats the surrounding air and if the flammable vapor is concentrated enough, causes an explosion. But other electronic devices installed in the gas stations are safe. \"All the electronic devices in gas stations are protected with explosive containment devices, while cellular phones are not,\" Tung explained. Mobile phone makers Motorola, Ericsson and Nokia, all print cautions in their user handbooks that warn against mobile phones in \"gas stations, fuel storage sites and chemical factories.\" But the danger is still being ignored by many users who continue to talk on their cellular phones while filling up at gas stations. \"Asking them to turn off the phone is the only thing we can do now, but not all the users like to : some of them even get mad with me,\" one attendant at a gas station complained. In fact, if danger is to be avoided, all transmitting devices - not just mobile phones - should be switched off near gas stations and locations housing flammable substances. Mobile phones should also be switched off near sensitive electronic equipment, in places such as hospitals and airports for public safety reasons.

They might be landmarks as considerable as a house you lived in, a school you attended, or a restaurant you frequented, or as unremarkable as a street sign, a water tank, or a tree.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "One such memory of mine is a rather unusual one. It involves a landmark that lasted only a few days before being destroyed; a landmark I never saw and was too young to be aware of during its short lifespan. Nonetheless, I grew up hearing the folklore of how it came to be and what happened to it, and studying the tantalizing remnant of its brief existence. The landmark of which I speak was the infamous Pink Lady, a 60-foot tall drawing of a naked woman which mysteriously appeared overnight on a sheer rock cliff above a tunnel on Malibu Canyon Road (one of several canyon passageways through the Santa Monica Mountains connecting the northwest portion of Los Angeles County to the Pacific coast) in October 1966: The Pink Lady was the handiwork of Lynne Seemayer (now Lynne Westmore), a 31-year-old secretary from Northridge, California. Motivated in part by the ugly graffiti adorning the rocks above and around a tunnel four miles north of Malibu \"[T]he tunnel was an eyesore,\" she said. \"If someone was going to that trouble, why not do something creative?\" Ms. Seemayer spent several months planning her art project and preparing her \"canvas.\" Starting in January 1966, she whiled away several nights each month (on evenings when the full moon provided adequate light) climbing the cliff and, tethered by nylon ropes, erasing the graffiti. Finally, by August 1966, the cliff face was sufficiently graffiti-free for her to sketch an outline of her planned drawing, which remained undisturbed (and largely unnoticed) for another two months. (She had originally hoped to draw a bird, but after she realized that its wings would be obstructed by brush she opted for the more vertical figure of a woman instead.) Finally, at 8:00 PM on Friday, 28 October 1966 (another moonlit night), Seemayer began her final assault on the Lynne Seemayer Westmore cliff with brushes and paint cans. By dawn, she had completed her work: a 60-foot-tall painting of a naked, pink-skinned, large-breasted woman with long flowing hair, captured in a running pose with a batch of flowers clutched in her right hand. For the first two days of her existence, the Pink Lady (as she was quickly dubbed) was mostly known only to those who glimpsed her while traveling northbound on Malibu Canyon Road. But by Monday word of the mysterious, titillating image had spread, and by Tuesday the Pink Lady was receiving widespread coverage in local newspapers and TV newscasts. She was also deemed to be a serious traffic hazard. Foreseeing potential traffic jams (motorists were already stopping their cars along the road to gaze) and accidents caused by distracted drivers, Los Angeles county officials quickly decided that the Pink Lady had to go. Early eradication efforts failed spectacularly: firefighters were unable to wash the Pink Lady away with their high-power hoses, and the liberal application of paint remover only deepened the blush of her pink skin. (Seemayer had used house paint for her creation, a substance which proved quite difficult to remove.) Only after the county's assault on the Pink Lady began did Seemayer step forward and reveal herself to be the artist behind the work. (The difficult-to-reach location and subject matter of the painting had led most observers to speculate that its creator was a man.) As the Los Angeles Times reported twenty-five years later: Westmore arrived on the scene, and was horrified. She had assumed that she would feel no sentimental attachment to the Pink Lady, but would easily forget her as with other art projects and move on to the next. But when she saw the road crew trying to erase her work, her emotionschanged. \"I usually don't have a feeling that everything I do is precious,\" Westmore said. \"But in this case, I became its mother, and it became important for me to save her. It was the most ridiculous thing I had ever seen.\" There was little Westmore could do. She had always wondered if the painting might land her in jail, and the county's response only heightened that concern. She stayed silent. Finally, when she realized the only way to stop the lady's removal was a court injunction, she went public. She appealed to [county Road Division head I. L.] Morhar to stop the proceedings. It made no difference. Neither petitions nor injunctions availed in saving the Pink Lady. On Thursday, 3 November 1966, as onlookers booed in disapproval, county workers blanked out the scarcely five-day-old Pink Lady with 14 gallons of brown paint. (The folklore that developed over the years later held that the Pink Lady had been removed only through the recourse of sandblasting her off the cliff face.) County workers paint over the Pink Lady, 3 November 1966 Although Lynne Seemayer [Westmore] saw some positive results from her efforts (art galleries, for example, quickly offered to show her work), much of the experience proved negative. She sued Los Angeles County for $1 million over the destruction of her work and the invasion of her privacy, and the county countersued for about $26,000 to recoup the cost of erasing the Pink Lady and managing the \"public nuisance\" she created. (Both lawsuits were thrown out after the court determined the Pink Lady had been painted on private property, and therefore neither party had standing to file suit.) On the Pink Lady's 25th anniversary, the Los Angeles Times chronicled some of the negative repercussions of her creation and removal: \"As I was leaving that day,\" said Westmore, who couldn't bear to watch her creation be removed, \"this woman came up to me and said, 'Let me just touch you.' That's when I knew this was starting to get out of hand.\" Another woman called Westmore every other night for two months, contending that the Pink Lady was an exact portrait of her young daughter who ran away from home. \"She thought I had used her daughter as a model,\" Westmore said. \"It was so pathetic. She was so convinced.\" Westmore received hate mail from people offended by the nude portrait, including one letter from someone threatening to tar and feather her and her two children and dump them off at Sunset Boulevard. She turned the letter over to the FBI. She received pictures of men masturbating. An arts group asked her to judge pictures that apes had painted. \"It was too crazy,\" she said. \"One woman accused me of all the rapes that had been committed, that the Pink Lady brought out the lust in men.\" Westmore changed her telephone number, but the calls kept coming. Finally, the stress was too much, and she was hospitalized with pneumonia and lost her job as a legal secretary. But even in the hospital she wasn't immune from attention. \"This nurse came in, wanting me to sign something,\" Westmore recalled. \"I thought it was for some kind of medical work, but she wanted an autograph.\" In the end, a sad result for a woman who had not sought to make a monetary profit or a grand political statement, but who had simply felt the urge to create a piece of art to \"do something that was [her] own.\" (Lynne Seemayer professed surprise at the controversy her Pink Lady created; she had even left a rope at the site so that she could go back and touch up her work later.) I never saw the unobscured version of the Pink Lady myself. My childhood landmark was an enigmatic and impenetrable blur that marked the spot where something of interest had once stood, augmented by the often inaccurate and embellished memories of those who knew the Pink Lady during her brief lifetime. Somehow that made her all the more intriguing.", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "", "Example": "", "Last Updated": "17 May 2013", "Credibility": "true", "URL":

an unpleasant fact of life in Los Angeles. The burgeoning population (close to 10 million for all of Los Angeles County at last count) and the great distances traversed daily by many L.A. commuters combine to overload the area's freeway systems. One breakdown in a key lane, or even a simple fender-bender, can cause traffic to back up for miles; fatal accidents or other impediments can close vital roads for hours at a time.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Every large city has its \"traffic watch,\" complete with helicopter reporters who spot-check the local freeways and broadcast traffic conditions to commuters through a variety of drive-time radio shows, but Los Angeles is a special case. Routine traffic updates that mention the nature and severity of congestion-causing incidents can easily rush through a dizzying array of freeway names and numbers in half a minute, and woe betide the less-than-attentive motorist who misses the key update for the freeway he was planning to take on a morning when something brings traffic to a standstill on that crucial road his inattentiveness may strand him for hours. Minor accidents and slowdowns are routine and, although annoying, are considered an ordinary part of the commute. But what about the large-scale interruptions; the overturned rig sprawling across three lanes, the five-car injury wreck, the hazardous materials spill, or the bomb threat? Los Angeles has a special name for its traffic updates about unforeseen incidents that have caused what will be lengthy lane closures: SigAlerts. The official Highway Patrol definition of a SigAlert is \"any unplanned event that causes the closing of one lane of traffic for 30 minutes or more, as opposed to a planned event like road construction, which is planned separately.\" SigAlerts are issued by the California Highway Patrol and are broadcast on Los Angeles radio and television stations, posted on the CHP web site, and signaled to motorists via electronic billboards on the freeways. Sensible folks immediately divert to alternate routes when they hear the dread term \"SigAlert\" applied to the route they were planning to take. Causes of SigAlerts are many and varied; some tragic, some funny. One of the more unusual SigAlerts was the Tuesday morning in October 1998 when a truck transporting ten tons of pies overturned on the transition from the Harbor to the Hollywood freeways, creating a pastry-coated traffic snarl that stretched for miles. The word SigAlert eventually became a common and familiar term to Southland drivers, even though few of them were aware of its origins or knew what criteria triggered such an alert. (Los Angeles traffic reporters say the question they're most frequently asked is 'What's a SigAlert?,' with the second most-asked question being \"What's the No. 1 lane?\") A genuine SigAlert is called when conditions create an unplanned freeway lane blockage of at least half an hour in duration (which might not sound like much to a nonresident, but we locals know how a spilled tennis shoe in one lane of a freeway can tie up everyone for hours). Since nearly everyone knew that the term 'SigAlert' announced major freeway congestion, and the name sounded official, most drivers who gave it any thought simply assumed the word was a shortening of \"signal alert.\" Other attempts to fathom what the \"Sig\" portion of \"SigAlert\" referred to produced some amusing entries, our favorite being the guess that it was an acronym formed from the advisory phrase \"stay in garage.\" It was a minor mystery that baffled many Los Angelenos for years, as the New York Times noted in 1997: \"When I was doing traffic I got more questions about 'What the hell is a Sigalert?' than anything else,\" said Bill Keane, who pioneered radio traffic reporting on KNX and retired in 1993, after 37 years on the air and who is credited with helping popularize the term. \"But nobody knew just where it came from. It got really big in the mid-70's.\" The answer is that SigAlerts gained their name from the man who developed the technology for speedily gathering and disseminating traffic information, Loyd C. Sigmon. In 1955, Sigmon was an executive co-owner of AM radio station KMPC in Los Angeles, part of the Golden West Broadcasting network of western radio and TV stations founded by cowboy singing star Gene Autry. Seeking a way to boost his station's ratings in the face of increasing competition from television, Sigmon came up with the idea of having the Los Angeles Police Department, who then patrolled Los Angeles freeways and dealt with accidents (functions now primarily handled by the California Highway Patrol), call his station every time a major accident occurred. Broadcasting alerts of accident-related freeway congestion to listeners, Sigmon reasoned, would give KMPC a competitive edge over both television and other local radio stations. Unfortunately, Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker rejected Sigmon's suggestion; he didn't want his officers diverted from their duties by having to phone a radio station to report every freeway accident. So Sigmon, who had served as radio engineer with the Army Signal Corps in Europe during World War II , put his ingenuity to work and created a device to automate the task. His invention was a combination of a short-wave receiver tuned to the LAPD frequency and a tape recorder when a police dispatcher broadcast an accident-related call to police units, he could push a button that activated the recorder on KMPC's receiver (by transmitting a special tone); the device would record the bulletin and then turn on a red light to signal radio engineers that an alert had been received. By rebroadcasting these bulletins, KMPC would be able to provide its listeners with traffic advisories far more up-to-the-minute than any competitor's. Although Sigmon's notification system was a technical success, it proved less of a commercial one. Chief Parker insisted that the system was too important to be used for the benefit of a single radio station and required that it be made available to everyone who wanted it. Sigmon was unable to gain the proprietary advantage he had envisioned for KMPC, nor did he ever profit personally from his invention, but Parker did give him due credit by coining the term \"SigAlert\" to describe the new high-tech traffic bulletins. SigAlerts became part of the Los Angeles driving experience by October 1955. While it is impossible at this time to pinpoint the incident that prompted the first broadcast of the traffic advisory, one of its first major uses took place on 22 January 1956, when a train leaving Los Angeles' Union Station for San Diego derailed downtown and rolled onto its side. 29 people died in that crash, and 120 were injured. Ironically, the initial SigAlert issued as a plea for emergency medical assistance drew such a heavy response that all the medical personnel rushing to the scene caused an even greater traffic jam than the train derailment itself. SigAlerts are restricted to traffic incidents these days, but in the beginning they were issued about all manner of items of concern: rabid dogs, a dam about to burst, gas leaks, and even an appeal on behalf of a druggist who had made a potentially deadly error in filling one customer's prescription. Those uses came to end after a SigAlert was issued to announce the collision of two ships in Los Angeles Harbor; at that point Police Chief Parker stepped in and announced, \"We're not going to run the traffic for the harbor.\" In 1993, the Oxford English Dictionary added \"SigAlert\" to its all-inclusive compendium of the English language, thereby signaling that it had joined \"couch potato\" as another Left Coast term to make it into the lexicon of everyday life. These days the term is no longer limited to Los Angeles or traffic conditions; its use is common in other parts of the USA, and it is often employed to stand for any type of warning or severe condition. Fortunately, Los Angeles experiences very little in the way of inclement weather, because local wisdom has it that a rainy day practically guarantees a SigAlert or three. Loyd Sigmon himself passed away at the ripe old age of 95 in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, on 2 June 2004.

Several types of devices are on the market which allow an officer, or tow truck operator, to unlock the vehicle by sliding a metal rod, commonly known as a \"slim jim\", between the door window and frame in order to access the control rods which unlock the door lock and handle. Once unlocked, the owner can enter the vehicle and retrieve the keys. Many devices have successfully been used for this purpose, including the well known coat hanger.

Inadvertent deployment of the airbag can cause the slim jim to be launched upward with great force. The force is strong enough to cause the device to penetrate the chin of the person attempting to access the vehicle, after which it can continue on to become lodged in the brain. Even when lockout assistance efforts do not prove to be deadly, the damage costs can be significant and may include thousands of dollars for replacement of the dashboard, which is designed to breakaway so as not to harm the driver or front passenger. The wiring for many of these side impact airbags is not shielded in any way, so a car opening tool can easily damage the wiring, causing malfunction or possible deployment of the airbag.Employees who find themselves in a situation where they need to get into a locked vehicle should be aware of the possible danger of deployment of the airbags for their own safety as well as the safety of others.",

"Numerous folks swear Interstate highways in the United States must be designed so that one mile in every five is perfectly straight and flat. According to this whispered bit of facetious lore, if the U.S. ever comes under attack, those straight, flat stretches will be used as landing strips.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Belief in this crazy idea should fail anyone's logic test. It makes no sense to render inoperable the Interstate highway system during times of domestic crisis moving troops and supplies on the ground would be too important an activity to curtail just to land planes. The U.S. is riddled with any number of small, private airfields that could be pressed into service if the need arose, with that need being dependent on some foreign power having first knocked out an almost uncountable number of major airports plus those airstrips on military bases, not to mention the American fleet of aircraft carriers. Folks who commit to believing this crazy notion of highways doubling by design as airstrips are letting the romance of a \"cool fact\" blind them to what their common sense should be blinking at them in bright neon letters. Richard Weingroff, information liaison specialist for the Federal Highway Administration's Office of Infrastructure and the FHA's unofficial historian, says the closest any of this came to touching base with reality was in 1944, when Congress briefly considered the possibility of including funding for emergency landing strips in the Federal Highway-Aid Act (the law that authorized designation of a \"National System of Interstate Highways\"). At no point was the idea kited of using highways or other roads to land planes on; the proposed landing strips would have been built alongside major highways, with the highways serving to handle ground transportation access to and from these strips. The proposal was quickly dropped, and no more was ever heard of it. (A few countries do use some of their roads as military air strips, however.) Some references to the one-mile-in-five assertion claim it's part of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. This piece of legislation committed the federal government to build what became the 42,800-mile Eisenhower Interstate Highway System, which makes it the logical item to cite concerning regulations about how the interstate highway system was to be laid out. The act did not, however, contain any \"one-in-five\" requirement, nor did it even suggest the use of stretches of the interstate system as emergency landing strips. The one-out-of-five rule was not part of any later legislation either.

himself as falling into that category. For this reason, we adore the notion of little easy-to-do tricks that will keep us, the occasional overindulgers, from being rounded up and tossed into the hoosegow as if we were actual miscreants who make our roads dangerous. It's not for those lawless killers who routinely get totaled then slip behind the wheel of a car, you understand. It's for us, the ordinary folk who get pulled over that one time we had a drink on our way home.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "All imaginary halos and denials aside, none of these tricks work. Pennies held in the mouth no more fool the breathalyzer than would hopping on one foot while reciting the Lord's Prayer. There's nothing magical about the presumed copper content of a one-cent piece that negates the test. (From 1982 on, the U.S. one-cent coin has been made of 97.5% zinc encased in a copper coating.) Likewise, although mints and various other breath treatments are at least somewhat effective at masking the odor of alcohol on the tippler's breath, they do nothing to affect the presence of demon rum in that person's system. In other words, even if the smell is not detectable, the alcohol itself is. Older breathalyzers measured the chemical reaction between the amount of alcohol expelled on the breath and the contents of a vial in a breathalyzer machine. Newer machines measure breath alcohol by the process of infrared absorption, which entails passing an infrared light wave through a sample chamber containing the subject's breath, then measuring the drop in the intensity of the light and using that to calculate the amount of alcohol in the subject's breath. It's important to delay the test for 20 minutes after the person being examined has had a drink else \"mouth alcohol\" might interfere with the results. (Traces of booze generally remain in the mouth for 10 to 15 minutes after a drink is taken. The 20 minute deprivation period allowed for this to dissipate.) Additionally, many police officers assert breathalyzer results can be compromised by the subject's burping while being tested (which they believe would increase the presence of mouth alcohol). That belief is more lore than science: According to a 1992 study performed at the Laboratory of Hygiene at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, belching had no effect on breathalyzer results. In one study subjects belched and blew into the instrument 15 minutes after taking a drink of alcohol; the reading was recorded then compared to another reading taken one minute later. There was no difference. Even when people would bring up a belch of gas directly into the instrument, there was no effect. Folks have done many strange things over the years in an effort to beat the machine. In a case heard in an Alberta courtroom in March 1985, 28-year-old Dave Zurfluh, who was stopped on suspicion of driving while under the influence, ate his undershorts in the belief they would soak up the excess alcohol in his system. According to Constable Bill Robinson, the arresting officer, he heard \"some ripping and tearing\" from the back of the cruiser. \"I looked in the back and he was tearing pieces of the crotch of his underwear out and stuffing them in his mouth,\" Robinson testified. We've no idea if the eating of the shorts was what got him off, but Dave Zurfluh was acquitted of all charges because he'd blown .08 on the breathalyzer, the legal limit. In March 2005 a 59-year-old accused drunk driver in Ontario tried to foil a police breathalyzer by stuffing his mouth full of feces. He had been taken to the police station for testing, where he grabbed a handful of his own waste \"and placed it in his mouth, attempting to trick the breathalyzer machine,\" said Sgt. James Buchanan of the South Simcoe Police. It didn't work. The machine registered two readings of intoxication from samples the suspect provided. Both were more than twice the legal limit. As for the \"penny\" canard, that too has been tried in real life. In August 2000, one East Hampton man pulled over for drunk driving was discovered to be sucking on a penny when approached for a breathalyzer sample. His speech was slurred, he couldn't stand up straight, and he failed all the standard sobriety tests, yet still he had faith in the \"penny under the tongue\" trick to save the day. The notion that \"smell of booze equals booze itself\" fuels the erroneous belief that breath improvers are effective counters to the breathalyzer test. Possibly in an attempt to cash in on this confusion, in 1997 a British company began marking \"Breathalyzer Blitz,\" mints advertised for their ability to rid breath of alcohol odors. The spokespeople for Blitz Design Corp. were always upfront in their denials that their mints would negate breathalyzer test results, but the name of the confection itself might well have misled many into believing these particular candies would have that effect. Also, those whose tipple of choice was Zima (a sweet colorless beverage especially favored by the younger set) were often under the mistaken impression that the booze in that particular concoction was not detectable via breathalyzer examination. Because Zima leaves little smell on the breath, its devotees concluded the alcohol contained in the beverage itself would prove similarly hard to pin down. They were wrong, of course, because Zima contained about the same amount of alcohol as ordinary beer, and the breathalyzer would always pick up on that. Yet this tidbit of lore proved surprisingly hardy and was often swapped among teens as a \"Did you know?\" revelation.

He was drunk and a cop pulled him over. He said the first thing he did was stuff a handful of pennies in his mouth and then spit them out as the officer approached the car. He said a short time later he was given a breathalizer test and because of the copper alloy residue (or whatever) the breathalizer tester went bonkers and they couldn't get an accurate evaluation and was off the hook. [Collected on the Internet, 2001] Here's something I heard a little over a year ago supposedly from a friend of a friend. At the time my friend told me that he heard that several states were trying to outlaw Icebreakers gum because it would disguise alcoholic content in breathalyzer tests and the readings would come out negative. As far as I know, Icebreakers is still being sold and I have yet to hear about a real lawsuit or a law being made to stop it.", "Last Updated": "9 April 2012", "Credibility": "false", "URL":

motorists only by following them in patrol vehicles for prescribed distances and estimating the offenders' speeds in comparison to their own. The development of radar guns allowed police to remain stationary alongside roadways and still catch speeders (as well as measuring their rate of travel more accurately). Then the advent of speed cameras (which use radar to track passing cars and automatically snap pictures of vehicles traveling in excess of speed limits) almost entirely removed humans from the process of catching speeders.", "Fact Check": "", "Description": "Now, many privacy advocates have been fearing that the next logical step will be the issuance of tickets to motorists who weren't actually caught in the act of speeding by either a human being or a speed-measuring device rather, drivers will be cited by \"average-speed cameras\" or \"point-to-point\" systems that track and photograph their progress between checkpoints through the use of some form of tag carried by drivers or their automobiles, record their elapsed times of passage between those checkpoints, use that information to estimate whether vehicles had to have been traveling in excess of speed limits at any portion of their journeys, and (if so) automatically issue citations. Such a scheme would prevent habitually speeding drivers from avoiding detection by learning the locations of speed traps and ordinary photo radar cameras and slowing down in their proximity. The \"camera tracking\" scenario raises concerns that citizens might have to defend themselves against citations that do not detail where, when, and by how much they were speeding, and warnings about that possibility circulated widely in 2007 (in the form of a rumor that New York would be using E-ZPass transponders or RFID chips embedded within vehicle registration stickers to catch speeders). A similar rumor was floated in mid-2009, one which claimed Florida would be replacing the call boxes along its interstate highways with cameras which would snap pictures of passing cars and issue tickets to those determined to have passed between two call boxes too quickly for the given speed limit. However, the implementation of such a system in any state is not imminent. As of June 2009 only two states in the U.S., Maryland and Arizona, were using any form of photo enforcement cameras on freeways , and Arizona shut down their freeway cameras in July 2010. Camera enforcement programs in California and Florida \"were dismantled after they were found to be operating outside of state law,\" and thirteen other states have laws specifically banning the use of freeway cameras. And all of the highway speed camera systems that have been tried so far in various states have been ordinary radar-camera combinations, not \"point-to-point\" systems that time drivers' progress between checkpoints and calculate an average speed. Although it's not completely beyond the pale of possibility that Florida or some other state might roll out a freeway speed camera system someday, legal and technical hurdles currently preclude the proposition cited in the first example quoted above that Florida will be replacing all its interstate call boxes with tracking cameras by June of 2010. In response to our inquiry to the Florida Department of Transportation (DOT), a representative with the Intelligent Transportation Systems Section of the DOT's Traffic Engineering and Operations Office told us that: The rumor is not true; the Department will not be replacing the call boxes with cameras to catch speeders. This rumor is not true for several reasons: 1) It is illegal. The Department does not have legislative authority to attach speed enforcement cameras on our call box poles 2) It is technically impossible. The call boxes do not have a dedicated power source which will be needed to operate the cameras. It would be cost prohibitive to run power to all the call boxes, making use of the poles impractical. The call boxes run off of a spring that powers a small generator which generates enough power to send a signal for assistance. The spring is tightened by pulling down a handle on the front of the box when the handle is released, the spring is released, running the generator. Once the signal is sent, the box reverts back to its powerless state. The Connecticut variant of this rumor cited above began circulating in January 2010, falsely attributed to a Danbury [Connecticut] News-Times article by Robert Miller. Likewise, that state's DOT has no legislative authority to issue tickets in such a manner, and the cameras along I-84 are not new and do not time motorists for the purpose of issuing tickets they are ordinary traffic cameras initially installed in the mid-1990s: The [Connecticut] state DOT does have cameras along I-84 and along other highways in the state. It also has radar set up along the road. It's had them both in place for years. [DOT spokesman] Kevin Nursick said the state uses the devices to monitor traffic flow. It can use the cameras to see if there's been an accident. It can use the radar to learn if traffic has suddenly slowed. But neither the DOT nor the Connecticut State Police have ever used this system for law enforcement for catching speeders and issuing tickets. In fact, it's specifically forbidden by state law to do so. \"We cannot use this equipment for law enforcement,\" Nursick said. \"You can't do it without a change in state statutes.'' Another iteration of this item originally circulated back in 2006 maintained that such point-to-point speed devices were in operation along Australia's M5 and M7 motorways: IMPORTANT INFORMATION: The M5 and the M7 are now equipped with Point to Point speed devices. Once you enter the M7 for instance, you pass the e-tag and it beeps. At the same time a camera takes a photo of your car and records the exact time. For those who have exited the M7, they would be aware that upon exit the e-tag system beeps again as you leave. At the same time another camera at that point takes a photo of the car and the time. Then the computer calculates the time it has taken you to travel between the two points and calculates your speed. If you have completed the clocked journey too fast, you are given a speeding ticket. At the present time the speed limit is 100kph and you have a tolerance of 102kph and no more. One fraction over that speed and you are issued with a fine automatically. Also remember that school zone camera;s are not speed tolerant. Anything over, even 41kph, is a fine. This means people will be doing 38kph to avoid any differences in their speedo readings Remember, this is going to be a very costly experience for some drivers. Itis also going to mean vehicles will be travelling at 95kph in order to ensure that no ticket is issued. What a shock some drivers are going to have when they have used this roadway for a week and get a week's worth of tickets BOTH WAYS. Of course your license will also be recalled for three months and you know the rest Take the advice and if you ignore it, remember this email when you pay all those fines. Also, remember that now with the new legislation, fighting a speed camera fines is almost impossible. You must prove the device is faulty and if you are not a technician working on them, you have no chance of beating the fine. Please also take into regard that the Pacific Highway has a set which are recognisable as the large steel frames over the lanes with a speed camera nearby and located some distance up the road is another large metal frame with a speed camera. These new point to point systems are being put onto any and all expressway or highway where vehicles are not able to exit between those points. Westlink M7 quickly debunked this version of the rumor as false as well: Westlink M7 has dismissed a hoax email currently circulating that claims that the motorway has implemented a secret speed fine based on the time a vehicle enters and exits the motorway. Flan Cleary, General Manager of Westlink M7, said that the email was a hoax and that no secret speed enforcement system operates on the Westlink M7. Westlink supports safe driving and urges all motorists to comply with posted speed limits. \"However, the secret speed fine system detailed in the hoax email does not exist,\" Mr Cleary said. \"Speed limits are enforced on the Westlink M7 through the normal policing measures that operate on all NSW roads.\" Mr Cleary said that Westlink will be installing signs that remind motorists that speed cameras are used in NSW. These are the standard speed camera signs seen on roads across the state and do not mean that any new or secret speed system operates on the Westlink M7. It is true, however, that average-speed cameras employing automatic number plate recognition technology have been put into place (at least on a trial basis) in a few locations around the world, primarily in Europe and the UK .", "Originally Published": "", "Referred Links": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-410539/Drivers-avoid-speeding-tickets--changing-lanes.html;https://web.archive.org/web/20060624005026/http://westlinkm7.com.au/news-Detail.asp?NewsID=80;http://www.ct.gov/dot/cwp/view.asp?a=2354&Q=290242;http://www.thenewspaper.com/news/27/2764.asp;http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/wayoflife/06/04/aa.speed.cameras.highways/index.html;", "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, July 2009] Starting June 1 2010 All Interstate in Florida, will have the Call boxes (on side of the interstate) replaced with Cameras that will take a picture of your tag at one box, and then another picture as you pass the next.
