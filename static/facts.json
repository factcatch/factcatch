[{"Origins":"As unbelievable as such stories must sound, babies have been left on the roofs of cars that were subsequently driven away. Such accidents of forgetfulness happen with surprising regularity, and it doesn't take all that diligent a search through old newspapers to dig up news reports documenting one such incident after another: In May 1992, three-month-old Matthew Murray of Worcester, MA, was left strapped in his baby seat on top of his dad's Hyundai. The vehicle got up to speeds of 50 mph on Interstate 290 before the seat slid off the roof, landing the baby (miraculously uninjured) on the busy highway. In December 1997, two-month-old Marcus Abram of the Chicago area was placed in his car seat on the roof of his mom's car while she moved things around inside to make room for two more passengers she was picking up. The child, still strapped to the car seat, fell off the roof of the car into a busy intersection with cars whizzing by in all directions. A passing trucker noticed the baby seat, stopped, and rescued the injured infant. The child fortunately suffered nothing more serious than lacerations to the face and head. In July 1980, six-week-old Brian Kornbach was left in his infant seat on top of the family car while the adults switched places in the front seat. The child was found by a roadside in Queens by a passerby who took the injured infant to the hospital. His parents did not notice they'd failed to bring their son in off the roof until they were somewhere in the Bronx. The above are just a few of the many instances of babies being left on car tops. It's not meant to be a comprehensive list, just a representative one to provide a better idea of how often this happens. Folklorist Jan Brunvand collected information on fourteen such incidents that had taken place between 1975 and 1993.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Some of the real-life babies who went flying off car roofs and into roadside ditches were injured by the experience. In lore, that never happens either the tot is rescued from the roof of the speeding car by a vigilant policeman, or is afterwards found by the side of the road, shaken yet unharmed. For once, lore is less brutal than reality. Barbara \"bouncing babies\" Mikkelson Sightings: Look for this tale in the 1987 film Raising Arizona and a 1990 episode of TV's Married With Children .","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093822;","Example":"Did you hear about this couple driving through Southern Utah? They were on their way to California, and they went to change drivers and the wife took the baby out of the car and put him on the roof of the car. Then they both switched sides and got back into the car. She just assumed that the husband had put the baby back in, but he hadn't even seen it. They drove off, and the baby slid off, but he was OK because he was in a plastic infant seat. About two hours later they realized that they forgot the baby. So they drove back, and someone had stopped for the baby, and the baby was OK. Variations: The situation which prompts the child to be left on the roof varies: It's a long drive and time to change drivers. The baby is placed on the roof while groceries are loaded into the car. When the car has a flat, everything has to be shifted about to get to the tire jack.","Last Updated":"7 April 2011","Credibility":1,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/mishaps/babyroof.asp","Claim":"A baby

 {"Origins":"On 5 August 2015, a wastewater leak out of an old mining site near Silverton, Colorado, affected the Animas River. According to the New York Times, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was investigating reports of a leak at the mine when a plug blew and flooded a nearby tributary: The Environmental Protection Agency caused the spill on Wednesday while it was investigating a leak at the Gold King Mine. The wastewater flowed into Cement Creek, a tributary of the Animas River in southwestern Colorado, and snaked through the river toward New Mexico.","Fact Check":"Did an accidental spill render the normally pristine blue Animas River a terrifying mustard yellow?","Description":"E.P.A. officials confirmed the leak contained heavy metals, including lead and arsenic, but said it was too early to know whether there was a health risk to humans or animals. The river was closed for recreational and other uses, but officials said water sources should be safe. The orange color is alarming to people, but that is not an indication in any way of a health risk, said Joan Card, an official with Region 8 of the E.P.A. Testing is ongoing, she said.

 {"Origins":"In an effort to encourage carpooling and thereby ease freeway congestion and lessen environmental impact, many municipalities have added High Occupancy Vehicle lanes to existing highways. HOV (aka carpool or diamond) lanes are restricted to those vehicles that have a stated minimum number of occupants or (in some parts of the U.S.) bear the appropriate stickers granting them that right (i.e. certain hybrid automobiles).","Fact Check":"","Description":"Because they are generally less populated than the rest of the highway, HOV lanes pose a temptation to unaccompanied drivers snarled in the daily commute and wistfully looking over at the more free-flowing diamond lanes. Heavy fines serve to keep most of the covetous to the straight, narrow, and more crowded, but not all. Some singletons choose to brazen it out and take the risk of being ticketed. Others attempt various deceptions designed to make it appear they have passengers in their vehicles. And then there are the pregnant women who will, when pulled over for HOV lane violations, claim their unborn children as additional people in their vehicles. Early in 2006, an Arizona woman tried just that. Candace Dickinson had been fined $$367 for improper use of a High Occupancy Vehicle (aka carpool) lane. She was caught driving in the HOV lane on Interstate 10 on 8 November 2005 even though alone in her vehicle. Sgt. Dave Norton of the Phoenix police made the stop. When he asked Dickinson how many people were in the car, \"she said two as she pointed to her obvious pregnancy,\" he said. Sgt. Norton said this was the second time in the last four years that a woman tried to use the defense against him, but the first one was a \"whole lot less pregnant\" than this driver. (Dickinson's son Cole was born on 23 November 2005.) Dickinson chose to fight the ticket by asserting in court that Arizona traffic laws don't define what a person is, so the child inside her womb justified her use of the lane. Phoenix Municipal Court Judge Dennis Freeman used a \"common sense\" definition of the statutes governing use of HOV lanes in which an individual occupies a \"separate and distinct\" space in a vehicle. \"The law is meant to fill empty space in a vehicle,\" Freeman said. The California Highway Patrol sees it the same way : I'm pregnant. The HOV lane requires two persons in a vehicle. Now that I'm eating for two, can I use this lane? California law requires that in order to utilize the HOV lane, there must be two (or, if posted, three) separate individuals occupying seats in a vehicle. Until your \"passenger\" is capable of riding in his or her own seat, you cannot count them. Other lone drivers have attempted to avail themselves of the convenience of the HOV-lane commute without legal penalty, with similar degrees of success. In February 2010, 61-year-old K.A. Franscinella of Mount Sinai, New York, attempted to fool those who police the carpool lane with a female mannequin sporting a long dark wig, blazer, shirt, and scarf. The officer who pulled her over immediately knew something was odd about the so-called passenger who was wearing sunglasses and using the visor on a cloudy morning. In January 2006, a driver was stopped and ticketed on U.S. 36 in Westminster, Colorado, for driving in a carpool lane with a mannequin he created by applying make-up to a wig stand and affixing it to clothing stuffed with newspapers (then strapping the finished product into the passenger seat with a seatbelt). In November 2005, Kevin Morgan of Petaluma, California, was handed a $$351 citation in Marinwood for driving in a carpool lane with a kickboxing dummy propped up in the passenger seat. The dummy was dressed in a baseball cap and Miami Dolphins windbreaker and wore a seatbelt. In March 2002, a motorist with a full-size mannequin as a passenger drove into the car-pool lane on Interstate 405 in Renton, WA, triggering a chain of collisions involving six cars and two buses. Susan Aeschliman-Hill of Kent, WA, had outfitted her immovable companion with a wig, sweater, and makeup. The accident occurred when Aeschliman-Hill darted into the carpool lane between two buses. Among those injured were fifteen students on a class trip. In 2001, a policeman in Atlanta pulled over a carpool lane violator who'd positioned a dummy in the passenger seat. The mannequin in question was wearing a sports jacket, a pair of sunglasses, and a baseball hat. Best of all, he had been positioned so he was holding a newspaper. Ruses motorists have used to conceal their driving alone in car-pool lanes: Store mannequins, blow-up dolls, kickboxing dummies, cardboard cut-outs, and even balloons (with faces drawn on them in marking pen). Buckling the passenger-side seat belt and pretending to talk to someone reclining in that seat. Covering an empty infant seat with a blanket or placing a doll in it. Taping a styrofoam wig stand to the passenger headrest and topping it with a blonde wig. Strapping the family pooch into the passenger seat. And no, lone hearse drivers transporting clients to their final rests cannot use the diamond lane.

 {"Origins":"On 30 August 2015, Facebook user Aria Brown shared a post reporting that professional political troll Ann Coulter had referred to President Obama as a \"retard\" in a tweet. That Facebook post, which also included a response from Special Olympics athlete John Franklin Stephens, quickly went viral and racked up more than a half million shares in 24 hours:","Fact Check":"Did Ann Coulter refer to President Obama as a \"retard,\" prompting a response from a Special Olympics athlete?","Description":"Some people who viewed the Facebook post questioned its authenticity, as they couldn't find the \"Obama retard\" tweet in Coulter's Twitter feed. The reason for that was because the referenced comment was one she made after a 2012 presidential debate between President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney, not something Coulter said in 2015 as implied by the Facebook post: Shortly after the tweet made headlines in 2012, Ann Coulter appeared on Alan Colmes' Fox News radio show to double down on her trolling: \"Look, no one would refer to a Down Syndrome child, someone with an actual mental handicap, by saying 'retard.' Where do you think the words 'imbecile,' 'idiot,' 'moron,' 'cretin' come from? These were all technical terms at one time. 'Retard' had been used colloquially to just mean 'loser' for 30 years ... But no, no these aggressive victims have to come out and tell you what words to use.\" The response from Special Olympics athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens is also real, although also not recent. On 23 October 2012, Stephens posted it as open letter to Coulter on the Special Olympics Blog: Dear Ann Coulter, Come on Ms. Coulter, you aren t dumb and you aren t shallow. So why are you continually using a word like the R-word as an insult? I m a 30 year old man with Down syndrome who has struggled with the public s perception that an intellectual disability means that I am dumb and shallow. I am not either of those things, but I do process information more slowly than the rest of you. In fact it has taken me all day to figure out how to respond to your use of the R-word last night. I thought first of asking whether you meant to describe the President as someone who was bullied as a child by people like you, but rose above it to find a way to succeed in life as many of my fellow Special Olympians have. Then I wondered if you meant to describe him as someone who has to struggle to be thoughtful about everything he says, as everyone else races from one snarkey sound bite to the next. Finally, I wondered if you meant to degrade him as someone who is likely to receive bad health care, live in low grade housing with very little income and still manages to see life as a wonderful gift. Because, Ms. Coulter, that is who we are and much, much more. After I saw your tweet, I realized you just wanted to belittle the President by linking him to people like me. You assumed that people would understand and accept that being linked to someone like me is an insult and you assumed you could get away with it and still appear on TV. I have to wonder if you considered other hateful words but recoiled from the backlash. Well, Ms. Coulter, you, and society, need to learn that being compared to people like me should be considered a badge of honor. No one overcomes more than we do and still loves life so much. Come join us someday at Special Olympics. See if you can walk away with your heart unchanged.

 {"Origins":"We began seeing this cautionary tale turn up in inboxes in November 2002. Although these accounts are probably \"real\" in the sense that they indeed reflect someone's attempt to describe an automotive mishap that actually happened to him, the explanation about a hydroplaning car's suddenly accelerating and \"taking off like a rocket\" due to the use of cruise control is a garbled one probably reflecting the author's misunderstanding of what had occurred.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Nonetheless, the warning inherent to the tale don't engage your vehicle's cruise control on slippery or wet roads is well worth heeding. Snow, ice, slush, or even rain can cause wheel-spin and loss of control, situations to which drivers must react quickly. Although cruise control can generally be cut off by the driver's simply tapping the brake pedal, the extra reaction time required for a motorist relying upon cruise control to recognize the danger of the situation when his wheels begins to spin or slide on a slippery surface, bring his foot up off the floor to the brake pedal, and disengage the cruise control can be crucial (especially for drivers lured into a hazardous level of inattentiveness on long, flat stretches of road). According to the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia's web page of tips about driving on wet roads: The only way to stop wheels from spinning and maintain control is to immediately reduce power. An activated cruise control system applies continuous power, keeping the wheels spinning. By the time you disengage the cruise control it may be too late you may have already lost control. An example from the weekly \"Drive It Forever'' automotive column by New York Times Syndicate writer Bob Sikorsky provides a description of one such occurrence: Dear Bob: Cruise control can be dangerous. I have experienced, when driving in heavy rain or slush conditions with the cruise control set at a speed of around 70 mph, that one front wheel will hydroplane while the other wheel suddenly gets traction. Result: The car spins out and into the ditch or into traffic. I have been lucky to be able to catch it happening and touch the brake and recover quickly. As a former pilot, I literally wear the car and feel its moves and respond accordingly. Use of the cruise control in these conditions can be dangerous. Enjoy your column every week keep up the good work. Sincerely, B.D., Albany, N.Y. A: While I haven't heard of this particular problem with cruise control, I can see your point and indeed the experience you describe sounds like a hazardous one. The safety implications for an average driver are considerable. I agree, in short: In heavy rain or slush, the cruise should not be set at a high speed. For that matter, though, even without the cruise engaged, high speed under the aforesaid conditions is dangerous in and of itself. You really shouldn't be driving at 70 mph in slippery conditions, cruise or no cruise. Nor should any driver. Wet-road driving is fraught with dangers that are not always immediately apparent. Just a thin layer of water lying on pavement can send an unsuspecting car hydroplaning into another lane the car's wheels skim along the water's surface instead of making contact with the road. Also, roads constantly accumulate oily substances loosed by car exhaust, and this residue settles deep into the pavement. Rain brings this oil back to the surface, making roads especially slippery during that first hour of downpour or misting. Likewise, winter driving carries with it a similar set of perils. Ice, snow, and sleet can make for dangerously slippery conditions, but so too can innocuous-looking slush and all-but-invisible \"black ice.\" Those who habitually rely upon their vehicles' cruise controls should eschew the practice during the winter months, because the moments it takes to disengage cruise may be moments you don't have during a spin-out. Barbara \"spin city\" Mikkelson","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"http://www.icbc.com/news/nov20-08;","Example":"[Collected on the Internet, 2002] I had a wreck a couple of weeks ago and totaled our Lincoln Town Car. I hydroplaned on Hwy 135 between Gladewater & Kilgore, Texas. I was not hurt, just emotionally rattled! I know the Lord was with me. I learned a lesson I'd like to pass on to you. You may know this already but the highway patrolman told me that you should NEVER drive in the rain with your cruise control on. He said if you did and hydroplaned (which I did) that when your tires were off the road your car would accelerate to a high rate of speed (which it did). You don't have much, if any control when you hydroplane, but you are totally in the hands of God when the car accelerates. I took off like I was in an airplane. I'm so thankful I made it through that ordeal. Please pass the word around about not using cruise control when the pavement is wet or icy. The highway patrolman said this should be on the sun-visor with the warning about air-bags. The only person I've found out who knew this (besides the patrolman) was a man who had a similar accident and totaled his car. This has made me wonder if this is not why so many of our young people are dying in accidents. Be careful out there! [Collected on the Internet, 2003] Some good advice, and you may know this already, but it is good to repeat! A 36 year old female had an accident several weeks ago and totaled her car. A resident of Kilgore, Texas, she was traveling between Gladewater & Kilgore. It was raining, though not excessive, when her car suddenly began to hydroplane and literally flew through the air. She was not seriously injured but very stunned at the sudden occurrence! When she explained to the highway patrolman what had happened he told her something that every driver should know NEVER DRIVE IN THE RAIN WITH YOUR CRUISE CONTROL ON. She had thought she was being cautious by setting the cruise control and maintaining a safe consistent speed in the rain. But the highway patrolman told her that if the cruise control is on and your car begins to hydroplaned - when your tires loose contact with the pavement your car will accelerate to a higher rate of speed and youtake off like an airplane.. She told the patrolman that was exactly what had occurred. We all know you have little or no control over a car when it begins to hydroplane. You are at the mercy of the Good Lord. The highway patrol estimated her car was actually traveling through the air at 10 to 15 miles per hour faster than the speed set on the cruise control. The patrolman said this warning should be listed, on the drivers seat sun-visor - NEVER USE THE CRUISE CONTROL WHEN THE PAVEMENT IS WET OR ICY along with the airbag warning. We tell our teenagers to set the cruise control and drive a safe speed but we don't tell them to use the cruise control only when the pavement is dry. The only person the accident victim found, who knew this (besides the patrolman), was a man who had had a similar accident, totaled his car and sustained severe injuries. If you send this to 15 people and only one of them doesn't know about this, then it was all worth it. You might have saved a life.","Last Updated":"12 April 2011","Credibility":1,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/techno/wetroad.asp","Claim":"Using cruise control on wet roads or during heavy rain can cause

 {"Origins":"If you have lived as an adult in the same area where you grew up, chances are you can recall at least a few fondly-remembered local landmarks of your childhood that no longer exist places or things that had special significance for you (if only in their familiarity) that have since been removed, replaced, or destroyed. They might be landmarks as considerable as a house you lived in, a school you attended, or a restaurant you frequented, or as unremarkable as a street sign, a water tank, or a tree.","Fact Check":"","Description":"One such memory of mine is a rather unusual one. It involves a landmark that lasted only a few days before being destroyed; a landmark I never saw and was too young to be aware of during its short lifespan. Nonetheless, I grew up hearing the folklore of how it came to be and what happened to it, and studying the tantalizing remnant of its brief existence. The landmark of which I speak was the infamous Pink Lady, a 60-foot tall drawing of a naked woman which mysteriously appeared overnight on a sheer rock cliff above a tunnel on Malibu Canyon Road (one of several canyon passageways through the Santa Monica Mountains connecting the northwest portion of Los Angeles County to the Pacific coast) in October 1966: The Pink Lady was the handiwork of Lynne Seemayer (now Lynne Westmore), a 31-year-old secretary from Northridge, California. Motivated in part by the ugly graffiti adorning the rocks above and around a tunnel four miles north of Malibu \"[T]he tunnel was an eyesore,\" she said. \"If someone was going to that trouble, why not do something creative?\" Ms. Seemayer spent several months planning her art project and preparing her \"canvas.\" Starting in January 1966, she whiled away several nights each month (on evenings when the full moon provided adequate light) climbing the cliff and, tethered by nylon ropes, erasing the graffiti. Finally, by August 1966, the cliff face was sufficiently graffiti-free for her to sketch an outline of her planned drawing, which remained undisturbed (and largely unnoticed) for another two months. (She had originally hoped to draw a bird, but after she realized that its wings would be obstructed by brush she opted for the more vertical figure of a woman instead.) Finally, at 8:00 PM on Friday, 28 October 1966 (another moonlit night), Seemayer began her final assault on the Lynne Seemayer Westmore cliff with brushes and paint cans. By dawn, she had completed her work: a 60-foot-tall painting of a naked, pink-skinned, large-breasted woman with long flowing hair, captured in a running pose with a batch of flowers clutched in her right hand. For the first two days of her existence, the Pink Lady (as she was quickly dubbed) was mostly known only to those who glimpsed her while traveling northbound on Malibu Canyon Road. But by Monday word of the mysterious, titillating image had spread, and by Tuesday the Pink Lady was receiving widespread coverage in local newspapers and TV newscasts. She was also deemed to be a serious traffic hazard. Foreseeing potential traffic jams (motorists were already stopping their cars along the road to gaze) and accidents caused by distracted drivers, Los Angeles county officials quickly decided that the Pink Lady had to go. Early eradication efforts failed spectacularly: firefighters were unable to wash the Pink Lady away with their high-power hoses, and the liberal application of paint remover only deepened the blush of her pink skin. (Seemayer had used house paint for her creation, a substance which proved quite difficult to remove.) Only after the county's assault on the Pink Lady began did Seemayer step forward and reveal herself to be the artist behind the work. (The difficult-to-reach location and subject matter of the painting had led most observers to speculate that its creator was a man.) As the Los Angeles Times reported twenty-five years later: Westmore arrived on the scene, and was horrified. She had assumed that she would feel no sentimental attachment to the Pink Lady, but would easily forget her as with other art projects and move on to the next. But when she saw the road crew trying to erase her work, her emotionschanged. \"I usually don't have a feeling that everything I do is precious,\" Westmore said. \"But in this case, I became its mother, and it became important for me to save her. It was the most ridiculous thing I had ever seen.\" There was little Westmore could do. She had always wondered if the painting might land her in jail, and the county's response only heightened that concern. She stayed silent. Finally, when she realized the only way to stop the lady's removal was a court injunction, she went public. She appealed to [county Road Division head I. L.] Morhar to stop the proceedings. It made no difference. Neither petitions nor injunctions availed in saving the Pink Lady. On Thursday, 3 November 1966, as onlookers booed in disapproval, county workers blanked out the scarcely five-day-old Pink Lady with 14 gallons of brown paint. (The folklore that developed over the years later held that the Pink Lady had been removed only through the recourse of sandblasting her off the cliff face.) County workers paint over the Pink Lady, 3 November 1966 Although Lynne Seemayer [Westmore] saw some positive results from her efforts (art galleries, for example, quickly offered to show her work), much of the experience proved negative. She sued Los Angeles County for $$1 million over the destruction of her work and the invasion of her privacy, and the county countersued for about $$26,000 to recoup the cost of erasing the Pink Lady and managing the \"public nuisance\" she created. (Both lawsuits were thrown out after the court determined the Pink Lady had been painted on private property, and therefore neither party had standing to file suit.) On the Pink Lady's 25th anniversary, the Los Angeles Times chronicled some of the negative repercussions of her creation and removal: \"As I was leaving that day,\" said Westmore, who couldn't bear to watch her creation be removed, \"this woman came up to me and said, 'Let me just touch you.' That's when I knew this was starting to get out of hand.\" Another woman called Westmore every other night for two months, contending that the Pink Lady was an exact portrait of her young daughter who ran away from home. \"She thought I had used her daughter as a model,\" Westmore said. \"It was so pathetic. She was so convinced.\" Westmore received hate mail from people offended by the nude portrait, including one letter from someone threatening to tar and feather her and her two children and dump them off at Sunset Boulevard. She turned the letter over to the FBI. She received pictures of men masturbating. An arts group asked her to judge pictures that apes had painted. \"It was too crazy,\" she said. \"One woman accused me of all the rapes that had been committed, that the Pink Lady brought out the lust in men.\" Westmore changed her telephone number, but the calls kept coming. Finally, the stress was too much, and she was hospitalized with pneumonia and lost her job as a legal secretary. But even in the hospital she wasn't immune from attention. \"This nurse came in, wanting me to sign something,\" Westmore recalled. \"I thought it was for some kind of medical work, but she wanted an autograph.\" In the end, a sad result for a woman who had not sought to make a monetary profit or a grand political statement, but who had simply felt the urge to create a piece of art to \"do something that was [her] own.\" (Lynne Seemayer professed surprise at the controversy her Pink Lady created; she had even left a rope at the site so that she could go back and touch up her work later.) I never saw the unobscured version of the Pink Lady myself. My childhood landmark was an enigmatic and impenetrable blur that marked the spot where something of interest had once stood, augmented by the often inaccurate and embellished memories of those who knew the Pink Lady during her brief lifetime. Somehow that made her all the more intriguing.","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"","Last Updated":"17 May

 {"Origins":"In August 2015, the above-displayed image (of an exceptionally large, Sicilian-style pizza) and a caption vaguely describing a pizza challenge was circulated on social media sites. According to rumors, the upfront cost for participating in the contest (purportedly $$218) was steep, but participants were eligible for a refund and a $$1,000 bonus if they consumed the entire pizza within a given timeframe (two hours, according to the meme). The pizza depicted is indeed a real menu item offered at Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria, a Southern California pizza chain. A small graphic displayed on the chain's web site alluded to the pizza challenge, as well as a prize of \"up to $$1,000\":","Fact Check":"Does a photograph show a real (giant) pizza, part of a challenge in which intrepid diners can win $$1,000?","Description":"However, that linked image led only to a \"coming soon\" message which offered no information about the pizza challenge or its stipulations. We reached out to Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria's corporate offices to determine whether circulating claims about the pizza challenge were true, and according the company the pizza challenge as described in the meme is mostly accurate. Of the twenty Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria locations in Southern California, five currently possess the capability to serve the giant Sicilian pie, and the challenge is most commonly undertaken at their Burbank location. Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria said that participating locations generally require 48 hours notice to prepare for the challenge. As the meme states, a challenge group consisting of eight (not nine) people has two hours to eat the entire pizza (which consists of approximately 200 slices, measures 54\" by 54\", and weighs about 50 lbs). The pizza must have at least one topping and costs about $$235, a price that is refunded should the participants successfully consume the entire pizza. The chain added that while three to four teams generally attempt the pizza challenge each month, so far only two contestant teams have managed to successfully complete the challenge and earn the $$1,000 prize.

 {"Origins":"On 7 November 2015, the UK newspaper The Guardian published a photo gallery showing the inside of the home owned by former neurosurgeon and current 2016 Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson. While the gallery featured several images of paintings, awards, and certificates on the walls of Dr. Carson's house, one particular portrait of Dr. Carson posing with Jesus caught the eye of social media users: Ben Carson's house is filled with his awards and pictures, like this one of him with Jesus https://t.co/8GItclguFg pic.twitter.com/k2slHIYRfw","Fact Check":"","Description":"Peter Feld (@peterfeld) November 7, 2015 Some people found the choice of home decor peculiar, and since many viewers came across the portrait of Dr. Ben Carson and Jesus through social media posts and not via a news article, many of them wondered if the photograph was real. While we haven't been able to locate an image of the portrait other than the one offered by the Guardian, we were able to track down confirmation from another publication that a portrait of Ben Carson and Jesus did indeed hang on the neurosurgeon's walls. In 2009, Baltimore Magazine published a profile of Carson which included a description of his home, referenced the portrait in question, and noted that the imagery of the picture was consistent with Dr. Carson's expressions of faith: The family room, where Carson likes to unwind over games of pool, ping pong, and foosball, is a sort of makeshift museum of the man known for his gifted hands, and [his wife] Candy is both keeper and curator. A quick glance at the cases and walls reveals more than 50 honorary doctorate degrees from such institutions as Spelman College, Morgan State University, and Yale as well as certificates, trophies, and statues from numerous preeminent organizations. The [couple's] strong faith is also a guiding force. \"We are very spiritual people so you will see a lot of Bibles around the house and things that are indicative of that,\" says Carson, who attends a Seventh Day Adventist Church in Silver Spring. \"I don't have to be politically correct here.\" He points to a stained-glass window in his foyer, a painting of him with Jesus, and his favorite proverb over the fireplace \"By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life\" Proverbs 22:4.

While most celebrity death hoaxes stem from fake news reports or humorless pranks, the rumor about actress Ashley Olsen's death was rooted in a real, and tragic, news story. The Associated Press reports that another woman named Ashley Olsen, an American artist and fashionista, was found dead in her apartment in Florence: The American artist and fashionista found dead in her apartment in Italy last week was strangled, according to autopsy results announced by Italian investigators Tuesday. The body of 35-year-old Ashley Olsen was discovered in her Florence home on Saturday. She died as a result of murder by strangulation with either a rope or cord-like object, authorities told reporters. Olsen, who is originally from Summer Haven, Florida, was living in the Oltrarno district of Florence and working in the fashion industry. She left the United States for Italy a few years ago to be close to her father, according to Italian news agency ANSA. In addition to sharing the same name, the former Full House star fit the \"American artist\" description and is also approximately the same age (29) as the murder victim. These similarities led many people to mistakenly believe that the Ashley Olsen who was killed in Italy was the same Ashley Olsen who appeared on the TV show Full House. On 12 January 2016, the artist's friends called for Italian authorities to bring her killer to justice: Olsen's friends demanded for her killer to be brought to justice in a letter that appeared in The Florentine, an English-language news magazine. \"Ashley was a rare and kindhearted spirit. She immediately became a familiar part of life in the Oltrarno where she lived, embraced by everyone who knew her,\" they wrote. \"While we mourn her passing we place our trust fully in the Italian authorities to investigate this tragic episode. We wait to hear what they discover, and pray that justice will be swiftly served to whoever is responsible.\" The investigation into Olsen's death is ongoing.
