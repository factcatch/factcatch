[{"Origins":"On 5 August 2015, a wastewater leak out of an old mining site near Silverton, Colorado, affected the Animas River. According to the New York Times, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was investigating reports of a leak at the mine when a plug blew and flooded a nearby tributary: The Environmental Protection Agency caused the spill on Wednesday while it was investigating a leak at the Gold King Mine. The wastewater flowed into Cement Creek, a tributary of the Animas River in southwestern Colorado, and snaked through the river toward New Mexico.","Fact Check":"Did an accidental spill render the normally pristine blue Animas River a terrifying mustard yellow?","Description":"E.P.A. officials confirmed the leak contained heavy metals, including lead and arsenic, but said it was too early to know whether there was a health risk to humans or animals. The river was closed for recreational and other uses, but officials said water sources should be safe. The orange color is alarming to people, but that is not an indication in any way of a health risk, said Joan Card, an official with Region 8 of the E.P.A. Testing is ongoing, she said.

 {"Origins":"In 1972, the alternative newspaper Vermont Freeman published an essay by Bernie Sanders entitled \"Man and Woman\" in which the future U.S. senator included a reference to a woman fantasizing about rape. After Sanders gained political prominence as a presidential candidate in 2015, that essay was brought to wider attention in a profile of Sanders published by Mother Jones on 26 May 2015: What Sanders did share with the young radicals and hippies flocking to Vermont was a smoldering idealism forged during his college years as a civil rights activist he coordinated a sit-in against segregated housing and attended the 1963 March on Washington but only a fuzzy sense of how to act on it. Sanders bounced back and forth between Vermont and New York City, where he worked at a psychiatric hospital. After his marriage broke up in the late 1960s, he moved to an A-frame farmhouse outside the Vermont town of Stannard, a tiny hamlet with no paved roads in the buckle of the commune belt. He dabbled in carpentry and tried to get by as a freelance journalist for alternative newspapers and regional publications, contributing interviews, political screeds, and, one time, a stream-of-consciousness essay on the nature of male-female sexual dynamics:","Fact Check":"Did Bernie Sanders write an essay in which a woman fantasizes about being \"raped by three men simultaneously\"?","Description":"That essay sparked a debate about Sanders and his views on women, and conservative outlets such as Young Cons, reproduced a portion of the essay in an attempt to illustrate how it was hypocritical for liberals to demonize Republicans for waging a \"War on Women\" when Sanders had written about a rape fantasy in a 1972 essay: According to liberals with IQs smaller than their sock size, conservative presidential candidates absolutely LOATHE women, hate them with a passion even. Those mean, old, white guys which is a hilarious stereotype given there's latinos, blacks, and women in the top spots for the GOP want nothing more than to destroy women s health care by defunding the ghoulish Planned Parenthood, and encourage rape culture with their antiquated views on gender roles. None of this is actually true, of course, but when have facts ever got in the way of the liberal agenda? What should really make you scratch your head is how lefties will rake conservatives over the coals for the things mentioned above, yet say absolutely nothing about this atrocious Bernie Sanders quote: But of course, plenty of publications on both sides of the political spectrum have said a good deal about \"this atrocious Bernie Sanders quote.\" NPR, for example, reported that: The essay by the Vermont senator isn't long only a page. The bit about rape comes at the very beginning, as does some not-totally-safe-for-work language: A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees, a woman tied up, a woman abused. A woman enjoys intercourse with her man as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously. The man and woman get dressed up on Sunday and go to Church, or maybe to their 'revolutionary' political meeting. Have you ever looked at the Stag, Man, Hero, Tough magazines on the shelf of your local bookstore? Do you know why the newspaper with the articles like 'Girl 12 raped by 14 men' sell so well? To what in us are they appealing? Sanders Sanders then goes on to explain his ideas about gender roles and eventually gets at a sharper point that traditional gender roles help create troubling dynamics in men's and women's sex lives. \"Many women seem to be walking a tightrope,\" he writes, as their \"qualities of love, openness, and gentleness were too deeply enmeshed with qualities of dependency, subservience, and masochism.\" One way to read the essay is that Sanders was doing (in a supremely ham-handed way) what journalists do every day: draw the reader in with an attention-getting lede, then get to the meat of the article in the middle. You can draw divergent conclusions from the article itself. On the one hand, he's talking about liberating people from harmful gender norms. On the other, with his nameless hypothetical \"man-and-woman\" characters, he also seems to imply that men fantasize about raping women or that women fantasize about being raped. CNN also covered the controversial essay in a piece that quoted Sanders' campaign spokesman describing it as \"stupid\" and a \"dumb attempt at dark satire\": Michael Briggs, Sanders' campaign spokesman, said the article was a \"dumb attempt at dark satire in an alternative publication\" that \"in no way reflects his views or record on women. It was intended to attack gender stereotypes of the '70s, but it looks as stupid today as it was then.\" Last updated: 22 September 2015","Originally Published":" 22 September 2015","Referred Links":"http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/28/politics/bernie-sanders-rape-essay-1972/index.html;http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/05/29/410606045/the-bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy-essay-explained;http://www.youngcons.com/this-bernie-sanders-quote-about-rape-should-horrify-women-everywhere/;http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/young-bernie-sanders-liberty-union-vermont;","Example":"[Collected via e-mail, September 2015] This quote about rape has been attributed to Bernie Sanders.

 {"Origins":"We began seeing this cautionary tale turn up in inboxes in November 2002. Although these accounts are probably \"real\" in the sense that they indeed reflect someone's attempt to describe an automotive mishap that actually happened to him, the explanation about a hydroplaning car's suddenly accelerating and \"taking off like a rocket\" due to the use of cruise control is a garbled one probably reflecting the author's misunderstanding of what had occurred.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Nonetheless, the warning inherent to the tale don't engage your vehicle's cruise control on slippery or wet roads is well worth heeding. Snow, ice, slush, or even rain can cause wheel-spin and loss of control, situations to which drivers must react quickly. Although cruise control can generally be cut off by the driver's simply tapping the brake pedal, the extra reaction time required for a motorist relying upon cruise control to recognize the danger of the situation when his wheels begins to spin or slide on a slippery surface, bring his foot up off the floor to the brake pedal, and disengage the cruise control can be crucial (especially for drivers lured into a hazardous level of inattentiveness on long, flat stretches of road). According to the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia's web page of tips about driving on wet roads: The only way to stop wheels from spinning and maintain control is to immediately reduce power. An activated cruise control system applies continuous power, keeping the wheels spinning. By the time you disengage the cruise control it may be too late you may have already lost control. An example from the weekly \"Drive It Forever'' automotive column by New York Times Syndicate writer Bob Sikorsky provides a description of one such occurrence: Dear Bob: Cruise control can be dangerous. I have experienced, when driving in heavy rain or slush conditions with the cruise control set at a speed of around 70 mph, that one front wheel will hydroplane while the other wheel suddenly gets traction. Result: The car spins out and into the ditch or into traffic. I have been lucky to be able to catch it happening and touch the brake and recover quickly. As a former pilot, I literally wear the car and feel its moves and respond accordingly. Use of the cruise control in these conditions can be dangerous. Enjoy your column every week keep up the good work. Sincerely, B.D., Albany, N.Y. A: While I haven't heard of this particular problem with cruise control, I can see your point and indeed the experience you describe sounds like a hazardous one. The safety implications for an average driver are considerable. I agree, in short: In heavy rain or slush, the cruise should not be set at a high speed. For that matter, though, even without the cruise engaged, high speed under the aforesaid conditions is dangerous in and of itself. You really shouldn't be driving at 70 mph in slippery conditions, cruise or no cruise. Nor should any driver. Wet-road driving is fraught with dangers that are not always immediately apparent. Just a thin layer of water lying on pavement can send an unsuspecting car hydroplaning into another lane the car's wheels skim along the water's surface instead of making contact with the road. Also, roads constantly accumulate oily substances loosed by car exhaust, and this residue settles deep into the pavement. Rain brings this oil back to the surface, making roads especially slippery during that first hour of downpour or misting. Likewise, winter driving carries with it a similar set of perils. Ice, snow, and sleet can make for dangerously slippery conditions, but so too can innocuous-looking slush and all-but-invisible \"black ice.\" Those who habitually rely upon their vehicles' cruise controls should eschew the practice during the winter months, because the moments it takes to disengage cruise may be moments you don't have during a spin-out. Barbara \"spin city\" Mikkelson","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"http://www.icbc.com/news/nov20-08;","Example":"[Collected on the Internet, 2002] I had a wreck a couple of weeks ago and totaled our Lincoln Town Car. I hydroplaned on Hwy 135 between Gladewater & Kilgore, Texas. I was not hurt, just emotionally rattled! I know the Lord was with me. I learned a lesson I'd like to pass on to you. You may know this already but the highway patrolman told me that you should NEVER drive in the rain with your cruise control on. He said if you did and hydroplaned (which I did) that when your tires were off the road your car would accelerate to a high rate of speed (which it did). You don't have much, if any control when you hydroplane, but you are totally in the hands of God when the car accelerates. I took off like I was in an airplane. I'm so thankful I made it through that ordeal. Please pass the word around about not using cruise control when the pavement is wet or icy. The highway patrolman said this should be on the sun-visor with the warning about air-bags. The only person I've found out who knew this (besides the patrolman) was a man who had a similar accident and totaled his car. This has made me wonder if this is not why so many of our young people are dying in accidents. Be careful out there! [Collected on the Internet, 2003] Some good advice, and you may know this already, but it is good to repeat! A 36 year old female had an accident several weeks ago and totaled her car. A resident of Kilgore, Texas, she was traveling between Gladewater & Kilgore. It was raining, though not excessive, when her car suddenly began to hydroplane and literally flew through the air. She was not seriously injured but very stunned at the sudden occurrence! When she explained to the highway patrolman what had happened he told her something that every driver should know NEVER DRIVE IN THE RAIN WITH YOUR CRUISE CONTROL ON. She had thought she was being cautious by setting the cruise control and maintaining a safe consistent speed in the rain. But the highway patrolman told her that if the cruise control is on and your car begins to hydroplaned - when your tires loose contact with the pavement your car will accelerate to a higher rate of speed and youtake off like an airplane.. She told the patrolman that was exactly what had occurred. We all know you have little or no control over a car when it begins to hydroplane. You are at the mercy of the Good Lord. The highway patrol estimated her car was actually traveling through the air at 10 to 15 miles per hour faster than the speed set on the cruise control. The patrolman said this warning should be listed, on the drivers seat sun-visor - NEVER USE THE CRUISE CONTROL WHEN THE PAVEMENT IS WET OR ICY along with the airbag warning. We tell our teenagers to set the cruise control and drive a safe speed but we don't tell them to use the cruise control only when the pavement is dry. The only person the accident victim found, who knew this (besides the patrolman), was a man who had had a similar accident, totaled his car and sustained severe injuries. If you send this to 15 people and only one of them doesn't know about this, then it was all worth it. You might have saved a life.","Last Updated":"12 April 2011","Credibility":1,"URL":"www.snopes.com/autos/techno/wetroad.asp","Claim":"Using cruise control on wet roads or during heavy rain can cause

 {"Origins":"NASCAR champion Tony Stewart hit fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr. at a race track in western New York state on 9 August 2014, fatally injuring Ward.","Fact Check":"","Description":"The two drivers had been involved in a minor collision moments earlier on the track at Canandaigua Motorsports Park, about 25 miles southeast of Rochester. During a sprint car race, Ward was spun out by Stewart, got out of his car to show his displeasure, and then was struck by Stewart's car, sending Ward sliding down the track. Video of the incident posted online showed that the 43-year-old Stewart, one of the biggest names on the NASCAR circuit, hit 20-year-old Ward when the latter approached Stewart's car on foot after the on-track incident: Ward was pronounced dead after being taken to a hospital in Canandaigua. Stewart was questioned and released by the Ontario County Sheriff's Office, and an investigation is ongoing. Stewart was in New York for the Cheez-It 355 NASCAR event the next day at Watkins Glen International but withdrew from the race.","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"[Collected via e-mail, August 2014] Is this true?

 {"Origins":"James Brown, the energetic soul singer famous for such top ten hits as \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" and \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\" as well as his trademark dance routines (such as his famous one-legged shimmy), has been tagged with many different nicknames during his more than fifty years in the music business: the Funky President, the Godfather of Soul, Soul Brother No. 1, the Ambassador of Soul, the Hardest Working Man in Show Business, and Mr. Dynamite. It was his wife, however, who made the most creative use of one of these sobriquets, when it was offered in her defense in an attempt to beat misdemeanor traffic charges.","Fact Check":"","Description":"On 3 September 1987, Brown's wife Adrienne was stopped in Georgia and charged with driving under the influence of drugs, speeding, and criminal trespass. She pleaded innocent to the charges, but before her case came to trial in June 1988, her lawyer tried a novel defense: diplomatic immunity. Back in 1986, the city of Augusta, Georgia, had held a James Brown Appreciation Day, and on that day, U.S. Representative Douglas Barnard of Georgia delivered a laudatory speech in which he stated that \"James is indeed our No. 1 ambassador.\" So, Adrienne Brown's lawyer, Allen W. Johnson, made a motion before the court offering Rep. Barnard's statement from two years earlier as proof of James Brown's ambassadorial status, maintaining that Brown was \"America's No. 1 ambassador and as such should have diplomatic immunity and such immunity extends to his wife, the accused herein.\" The ploy didn't work. Johnson withdrew the motion the next day, claiming that he had filed it only because he was pressed for time and \"was trying to pursue every possible avenue of defense,\" and that he had \"since determined that the congressman intended his comments as a goodwill gesture and a figure of speech,\" not as a literal recognition of Brown's ambassadorial status. In any case, Johnson's motion was bound to fail: Diplomatic immunity shields officials of foreign nations from criminal charges while they represent their countries in the United States, and United States officials while they represent America in other countries. Such immunity therefore does not extend to American citizens who commit crimes in the USA, ambassadors or not.","Originally Published":"","Referred Links":"","Example":"","Last Updated":"9 November

 {"Origins":"On 7 November 2015, the UK newspaper The Guardian published a photo gallery showing the inside of the home owned by former neurosurgeon and current 2016 Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson. While the gallery featured several images of paintings, awards, and certificates on the walls of Dr. Carson's house, one particular portrait of Dr. Carson posing with Jesus caught the eye of social media users: Ben Carson's house is filled with his awards and pictures, like this one of him with Jesus https://t.co/8GItclguFg pic.twitter.com/k2slHIYRfw","Fact Check":"","Description":"Peter Feld (@peterfeld) November 7, 2015 Some people found the choice of home decor peculiar, and since many viewers came across the portrait of Dr. Ben Carson and Jesus through social media posts and not via a news article, many of them wondered if the photograph was real. While we haven't been able to locate an image of the portrait other than the one offered by the Guardian, we were able to track down confirmation from another publication that a portrait of Ben Carson and Jesus did indeed hang on the neurosurgeon's walls. In 2009, Baltimore Magazine published a profile of Carson which included a description of his home, referenced the portrait in question, and noted that the imagery of the picture was consistent with Dr. Carson's expressions of faith: The family room, where Carson likes to unwind over games of pool, ping pong, and foosball, is a sort of makeshift museum of the man known for his gifted hands, and [his wife] Candy is both keeper and curator. A quick glance at the cases and walls reveals more than 50 honorary doctorate degrees from such institutions as Spelman College, Morgan State University, and Yale as well as certificates, trophies, and statues from numerous preeminent organizations. The [couple's] strong faith is also a guiding force. \"We are very spiritual people so you will see a lot of Bibles around the house and things that are indicative of that,\" says Carson, who attends a Seventh Day Adventist Church in Silver Spring. \"I don't have to be politically correct here.\" He points to a stained-glass window in his foyer, a painting of him with Jesus, and his favorite proverb over the fireplace \"By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life\" Proverbs 22:4.

 {"Origins":"Most of us probably don't stop to ponder why the maze of U.S. interstates and highways we travel in our automobiles are numbered the way they are just trying to find the correct road, get on it heading the right direction, and exit at the proper off-ramp is challenge enough. There actually is a rhyme and a reason to the numbering system used for U.S. highways, although the rhymes and reasons vary for different types of roads. Highways generally fall into one of three classes which generally use similar (but not identical) rules in assigning numbers: Interstate highways established under the aegis of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. U.S. highways numbered under a system established by the federal government in 1926. Regional roads numbered under individual state and county systems. INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS: Under the plan developed for a national interstate highway system during the Eisenhower administration, interstate highways (marked with the familiar red-and-blue shields) are numbered according to the following rules:","Fact Check":"","Description":"And, just to make things even more confusing, there are quirky exceptions to these rules: I-238 is not a spur off Interstate 38, because Interstate 38 doesn't exist. (The curious can read Grant Cooper's lengthy explanation of how this came to be.) Interstate 99 was assigned a high two-digit number (through legislation), even though it is not a major highway (it runs for only 58 miles between Wolfsburg and Bald Eagle in Pennsylvania) and is farther west than other interstates with lower numbers. U.S. HIGHWAYS: U.S. Highways (or Routes), marked with black-and-white badge-shaped signs, are assigned one- to three-digit numbers. Like interstate highways, they designate north-south roads with odd numbers and east-west roads with even numbers, but the numbering scheme is inverted: the numbers of north-south routes grow larger from east to west, and the numbers of east-west routes grow larger from north to south. NORTH-SOUTH EXAMPLES: US Highway 1 runs from Fort Kent, Maine, to Key West, Florida. US Highway 99 used to run from the Canadian border at Blaine, Washington, almost to the Mexican border at the city of Calexico, California. (Highway 99 has since been supplanted by Interstate 5 and is no longer designated as a U.S. Highway.) EAST-WEST EXAMPLES: US Highway 14 runs from Chicago, Illinois to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. US Highway 82 runs from Alamogordo, New Mexico, to Brunswick, Georgia. STATE AND COUNTY ROUTES: Individual states and counties use different types of signage to designate regional state and county roads. For the most part, states follow the Interstate and U.S. Highway patterns of assigning odd numbers to north-south routes and even numbers to east-west routes, but as always there are exceptions. California's Antelope Valley Freeway runs almost due north from the Los Angeles basin through the high desert, yet it's the 14 Freeway. In answer to that perennial trivia question, the state of Hawaii has three roads designated as interstate highways (all of them on the island of Oahu) because roads established under the purview of the Federal Aid Highway Act and receiving funding from the federal government are considered interstate highways, even if they fall completely within the borders of a single state. Hawaii's interstate highways are somewhat different than other interstates in that they are identified with numbers preceded by the letter H rather than the standard I, however.","Originally

This image was likely inspired by a December 2015 Washington Post article which reported that Sanders was the only one of 16 presidential candidates (in any party) currently paying his campaign interns: In August, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton tweeted an application for unpaid interns, requiring a r sum and two letters of reference. Just a few days later, she was posting about the student debt crisis. On the Republican side, former Florida governor Jeb Bush has called the opportunity gap \"the defining issue of our time,\" and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has railed against \"upward-mobility stagnation.\" Like Clinton, both of them have proposals to reduce student debt. Even retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson wants public universities to pay the interest on student loans, while business mogul Donald Trump has accused the federal government of profiting off students. But of the 16 candidates running for president, only one pays his interns: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), at $$10.10 an hour. While it may be generally accurate to say that Bernie Sanders is one of the few (if not the only) 2016 presidential candidate paying his interns, a few exceptions and clarifications that should be noted. First, the candidates offering unpaid internships are not breaking any laws. In most cases, it is perfectly legal to hire interns for non-paying positions as long as those interns receive some tangible benefit (such as school credit or valuable work experience) in return. Second, some candidates, such as Republican Ben Carson, do offer their interns others forms of compensation, such as stipends for food or travel. And neither we nor the Washington Post have been able to determine if GOP candidate Donald Trump's campaigns offers internships (or, if so, whether those internships are paid positions), although we note that interns at Trump Entertainment Resorts are reportedly paid $$10 an hour. The campaign teams of Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie have all recently posted advertisements seeking interns for non-paying positions. A recent posting on Bernie Sanders' web site, on the other hand, advertises a paid internship position (although such ads do not necessarily indicate that all campaign internship positions are paying ones): Bernie 2016 is currently looking for a full-time Digital Intern. This position will require working directly with the Digital and Social Media Directors. This is a paid internship based in Washington, D.C. Unpaid internships are quite common in politics. A 2013 study by the Atlantic found that only one-third of U.S. senators paid their interns. That article also criticized Democratic senators for being more stingy in their use of unpaid interns while singling out Bernie Sanders (technically an independent) as an exception to the rule: [E]mbarrassingly, the vast majority of senators who do pay [their interns] are Republicans. Of those 35 senators [who pay their interns], only 11 are Democrats meaning almost 80 percent of Dems require volunteer participation (not counting Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats). This is peculiar and troubling for a party that elsewhere signals its commitment to fair pay, equal representation, economic inequality, and workplace welfare. When it comes to interns in the Senate, it seems that traditional beliefs about labor and economic opportunity are suddenly switched. Although President Obama is not pictured in the above-displayed image (since he is not a candidate in the 2016 presidential campaign), we also note that White House internships provide neither pay nor housing for those who fill such positions.

 {"Origins":"Traffic snarls and interminable drive-time delays are an unpleasant fact of life in Los Angeles. The burgeoning population (close to 10 million for all of Los Angeles County at last count) and the great distances traversed daily by many L.A. commuters combine to overload the area's freeway systems. One breakdown in a key lane, or even a simple fender-bender, can cause traffic to back up for miles; fatal accidents or other impediments can close vital roads for hours at a time.","Fact Check":"","Description":"Every large city has its \"traffic watch,\" complete with helicopter reporters who spot-check the local freeways and broadcast traffic conditions to commuters through a variety of drive-time radio shows, but Los Angeles is a special case. Routine traffic updates that mention the nature and severity of congestion-causing incidents can easily rush through a dizzying array of freeway names and numbers in half a minute, and woe betide the less-than-attentive motorist who misses the key update for the freeway he was planning to take on a morning when something brings traffic to a standstill on that crucial road his inattentiveness may strand him for hours. Minor accidents and slowdowns are routine and, although annoying, are considered an ordinary part of the commute. But what about the large-scale interruptions; the overturned rig sprawling across three lanes, the five-car injury wreck, the hazardous materials spill, or the bomb threat? Los Angeles has a special name for its traffic updates about unforeseen incidents that have caused what will be lengthy lane closures: SigAlerts. The official Highway Patrol definition of a SigAlert is \"any unplanned event that causes the closing of one lane of traffic for 30 minutes or more, as opposed to a planned event like road construction, which is planned separately.\" SigAlerts are issued by the California Highway Patrol and are broadcast on Los Angeles radio and television stations, posted on the CHP web site, and signaled to motorists via electronic billboards on the freeways. Sensible folks immediately divert to alternate routes when they hear the dread term \"SigAlert\" applied to the route they were planning to take. Causes of SigAlerts are many and varied; some tragic, some funny. One of the more unusual SigAlerts was the Tuesday morning in October 1998 when a truck transporting ten tons of pies overturned on the transition from the Harbor to the Hollywood freeways, creating a pastry-coated traffic snarl that stretched for miles. The word SigAlert eventually became a common and familiar term to Southland drivers, even though few of them were aware of its origins or knew what criteria triggered such an alert. (Los Angeles traffic reporters say the question they're most frequently asked is 'What's a SigAlert?,' with the second most-asked question being \"What's the No. 1 lane?\") A genuine SigAlert is called when conditions create an unplanned freeway lane blockage of at least half an hour in duration (which might not sound like much to a nonresident, but we locals know how a spilled tennis shoe in one lane of a freeway can tie up everyone for hours). Since nearly everyone knew that the term 'SigAlert' announced major freeway congestion, and the name sounded official, most drivers who gave it any thought simply assumed the word was a shortening of \"signal alert.\" Other attempts to fathom what the \"Sig\" portion of \"SigAlert\" referred to produced some amusing entries, our favorite being the guess that it was an acronym formed from the advisory phrase \"stay in garage.\" It was a minor mystery that baffled many Los Angelenos for years, as the New York Times noted in 1997: \"When I was doing traffic I got more questions about 'What the hell is a Sigalert?' than anything else,\" said Bill Keane, who pioneered radio traffic reporting on KNX and retired in 1993, after 37 years on the air and who is credited with helping popularize the term. \"But nobody knew just where it came from. It got really big in the mid-70's.\" The answer is that SigAlerts gained their name from the man who developed the technology for speedily gathering and disseminating traffic information, Loyd C. Sigmon. In 1955, Sigmon was an executive co-owner of AM radio station KMPC in Los Angeles, part of the Golden West Broadcasting network of western radio and TV stations founded by cowboy singing star Gene Autry. Seeking a way to boost his station's ratings in the face of increasing competition from television, Sigmon came up with the idea of having the Los Angeles Police Department, who then patrolled Los Angeles freeways and dealt with accidents (functions now primarily handled by the California Highway Patrol), call his station every time a major accident occurred. Broadcasting alerts of accident-related freeway congestion to listeners, Sigmon reasoned, would give KMPC a competitive edge over both television and other local radio stations. Unfortunately, Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker rejected Sigmon's suggestion; he didn't want his officers diverted from their duties by having to phone a radio station to report every freeway accident. So Sigmon, who had served as radio engineer with the Army Signal Corps in Europe during World War II , put his ingenuity to work and created a device to automate the task. His invention was a combination of a short-wave receiver tuned to the LAPD frequency and a tape recorder when a police dispatcher broadcast an accident-related call to police units, he could push a button that activated the recorder on KMPC's receiver (by transmitting a special tone); the device would record the bulletin and then turn on a red light to signal radio engineers that an alert had been received. By rebroadcasting these bulletins, KMPC would be able to provide its listeners with traffic advisories far more up-to-the-minute than any competitor's. Although Sigmon's notification system was a technical success, it proved less of a commercial one. Chief Parker insisted that the system was too important to be used for the benefit of a single radio station and required that it be made available to everyone who wanted it. Sigmon was unable to gain the proprietary advantage he had envisioned for KMPC, nor did he ever profit personally from his invention, but Parker did give him due credit by coining the term \"SigAlert\" to describe the new high-tech traffic bulletins. SigAlerts became part of the Los Angeles driving experience by October 1955. While it is impossible at this time to pinpoint the incident that prompted the first broadcast of the traffic advisory, one of its first major uses took place on 22 January 1956, when a train leaving Los Angeles' Union Station for San Diego derailed downtown and rolled onto its side. 29 people died in that crash, and 120 were injured. Ironically, the initial SigAlert issued as a plea for emergency medical assistance drew such a heavy response that all the medical personnel rushing to the scene caused an even greater traffic jam than the train derailment itself. SigAlerts are restricted to traffic incidents these days, but in the beginning they were issued about all manner of items of concern: rabid dogs, a dam about to burst, gas leaks, and even an appeal on behalf of a druggist who had made a potentially deadly error in filling one customer's prescription. Those uses came to end after a SigAlert was issued to announce the collision of two ships in Los Angeles Harbor; at that point Police Chief Parker stepped in and announced, \"We're not going to run the traffic for the harbor.\" In 1993, the Oxford English Dictionary added \"SigAlert\" to its all-inclusive compendium of the English language, thereby signaling that it had joined \"couch potato\" as another Left Coast term to make it into the lexicon of everyday life. These days the term is no longer limited to Los Angeles or traffic conditions; its use is common in other parts of the USA, and it is often employed to stand for any type of warning or severe condition. Fortunately, Los Angeles experiences very little in the way of inclement weather, because local wisdom has it that a rainy day practically guarantees a SigAlert or three. Loyd Sigmon himself passed away at the ripe old age of 95 in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, on 2 June 2004.
