                        On 14 July 2015, the web site Newswatch33 published an article titled NASA Confirms Earth Will
                        Experience 15 Days of Complete Darkness in November 2015, claiming: NASA has confirmed that the
                        Earth will experience 15 days of total darkness between November 15 and November 29, 2015. The
                        event, according to NASA, hasn't occurred in over 1 Million years.

                    <span>
                        Astronomers from NASA have indicated that the world will remain in complete darkness starting on
                        Sunday, November 15, 2015 at 3 a.m. and will end on Monday, November 30, 2015 at 4:15 p.m.
                        According to <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> officials, the \"November Black Out\"
                            event will be caused by another astronomical event between Venus and Jupiter. Charles
                            Bolden, who was appointed to head of NASA by President Obama, issued a 1000 page document
                            explaining the event to the White House. While Charles Bolden is a real NASA official, the
                            Newswatch33 web site is not a legitimate news outlet. Newswatch33 is a fake news site began
                            darkening the doorstep of social media networks shortly after the nearly identical
                            NewsWatch28 fake news site shut down in mid-2015. Moreover, the \"15 days of darkness\" yarn
                            was lifted from an older (debunked) viral rumor that has been around the online block
                            several times before. Newswatch33 has hoaxed social media users a number of times since its
                            inception, falsely claiming that supporters raised $4 million for the defense of Charleston
                            shooting suspect Dylann Roof, that a girl was electrocuted by her iPhone's earbuds, that
                            Jay-Z and Beyonce purchased the rights to the Confederate flag, and that the federal
                            government had impregnated inexpensive cigars with listening devices. In October 2015, the
                            fake news web site Huzlers published an article titled \"NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience
                            6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2015!\"; that article essentially repackaged the
                            original fabrication. Previous Huzlers hoaxes included a claim that semen was found in
                            Starbucks drinks nationwide, that McDonald's was busted using \"human meat,\" that Chipotle
                            was caught using cat and dog meat in their meals, and that an Ebola victim rose from the
                            dead as a zombie. Last updated: 4 December 2015</span>

                        [Collected via e-mail, December 2015] I can't find if this is true or not. Nasa confirms that we
                        will have 8 days of darkness from December 15 thru the 23rd. I have looked on Snopes, so far
                        nothing. Are we?
